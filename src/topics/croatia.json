Croatia continued to suffer deep economic and political divisions, particularly over cooperation with the <a href=\"/topic/International-Criminal-Tribunal-for-the-Former-Yugoslavia\">International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY), which indicted several Croatian generals who, according to many Croats, had heroic wartime reputations.","With the success of the HDZ in the 2003 parliamentary elections, Croatia’s broad-based <a href=\"/topic/coalition-government\">coalition government</a> fell, and HDZ leader Ivo Sanader became prime minister of a new centre-right government. In 2004 Croatia became an official EU candidate, but negotiations were postponed in 2005 after the ICTY raised concerns about the country’s commitment to bringing war criminals to <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/justice\">justice</a>. EU officials also questioned Croatia’s dedication to eliminating corruption. By the following year, however, several key suspects had been arrested or tried for war crimes, and the government had adopted a strong anticorruption strategy. These developments <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bolstered\">bolstered</a> hopes that Croatia could join the EU by the end of the decade. Meanwhile, the country’s economy, helped by the spectacular growth of tourism, began to improve. The status of the much-reduced Serb minority also was boosted by the inclusion of an ethnic Serb in the cabinet of the HDZ-led coalition government that came to power in 2008. On April 1, 2009, NATO officially welcomed Croatia as a member of the alliance.","By mid-2009 the outlook was not as promising. Although neighbouring <a href=\"/place/Slovenia\">Slovenia</a>—a member of both NATO and the EU—had agreed to Croatia’s NATO membership, it continued to block Croatian accession negotiations with the EU, claiming that the countries’ ongoing border dispute needed to be resolved first. (The dispute, focused on the maritime border in the Bay of Piran, had originated in 1991 when both countries seceded from Yugoslavia.) Adding to Croatia’s problems, the growing global financial crisis caused the economy to contract sharply during the first half of 2009, and by the end of the year it had suffered a decline of 6 percent of <a href=\"/topic/gross-domestic-product\">gross domestic product</a>. Croatia faced yet another hurdle when Prime Minister Sanader resigned on July 1, 2009. Fellow HDZ member Jadranka Kosor, who had been serving as deputy prime minister, succeeded Sanader. She was the first woman to hold the Croatian prime ministership.","In January 2010 Ivo Josipović, a member of the opposition Social Democratic Party of Croatia (Socijaldemokratska partija Hrvatske; SDP), was elected president. Despite his political differences with the ruling HDZ, he promised to support Prime Minister Kosor’s goals of expediting EU membership talks and fighting corruption. Nevertheless, the relative inexperience of the two new leaders and the jockeying of their parties for advantage in the 2011 parliamentary elections kept their differences in play. The HDZ’s continued emphasis on an exclusively Croatian national identity and history still separated its adherents from many younger urban voters and the remaining Serb minority. Some HDZ supporters, for instance, objected to the public apology that President Josipović made in April 2010 to Bosnia and Herzegovina for Croatia’s role in the warfare there in the early 1990s. Meanwhile, the SDP was drawn into the public’s continued concerns about EU membership when one of the party’s major supporters, a large public employees’ union, objected to labour-related conditions imposed by the EU on prospective members. The objections slowed the full-scale labour reform that would be needed for EU accession. Larger concerns for EU accession, however, remained judicial reform in general and the conclusion of several corruption trials in particular. Still, the fact that both major parties and the respected Croatian National Bank supported membership in the EU was a major advantage in the accession process, which had gained momentum after November 2009, when Slovenia and Croatia agreed to have their border dispute settled by international arbitration.","After more than a decade of effort and six years of formal talks, the accession process reached a final milestone in June 2011, when Croatia closed negotiations with the EU. This accomplishment did little to <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bolster\">bolster</a> public approval of the HDZ, however, as corruption scandals—the most notable involving former prime minister Sanader—bogged down the party throughout the year. Croatia also struggled with the economic <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/malaise\">malaise</a> that had afflicted the rest of Europe, and, like ruling parties across the continent throughout 2011, the HDZ suffered for it at the polls. In the general election on December 4, 2011, the opposition Kukuriku coalition, headed by Zoran Milanović, swept the HDZ from power and claimed an overall majority in parliament, winning 80 of 151 seats. Just days after the election, as Milanović began the work of constructing his government, Croatia signed the accession treaty that would enable it to join the EU in 2013. In a referendum held in January 2012, accession received approval from two-thirds of Croatian voters, but voter turnout, at 43.6 percent, marked the lowest level of participation for any poll on EU entry. Nevertheless, thousands celebrated in Zagreb on July 1, 2013, when Croatia completed its decadelong accession journey to become the 28th member of the EU."],"sections":[],"isFilled":true}],"isFilled":true},"ref43554":{"level":2,"id":"ref43554","sidebarHeader":"Croatia to the Ottoman conquests","header":"Croatia to the Ottoman conquests","paragraphs":["The lands where the <a href=\"/topic/Croat\">Croats</a> would settle and establish their state lay just within the borders of the Western Roman Empire.

The necessity of relying on the other South Slavs in opposition to the Habsburgs and Hungarians also kept alive the Illyrian idea, revived in the 1860s under the name Yugoslavism.

Croatia continued to suffer deep economic and political divisions, particularly over cooperation with the <a href=\"/topic/International-Criminal-Tribunal-for-the-Former-Yugoslavia\">International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY), which indicted several Croatian generals who, according to many Croats, had heroic wartime reputations.","With the success of the HDZ in the 2003 parliamentary elections, Croatia’s broad-based <a href=\"/topic/coalition-government\">coalition government</a> fell, and HDZ leader Ivo Sanader became prime minister of a new centre-right government. In 2004 Croatia became an official EU candidate, but negotiations were postponed in 2005 after the ICTY raised concerns about the country’s commitment to bringing war criminals to <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/justice\">justice</a>. EU officials also questioned Croatia’s dedication to eliminating corruption. By the following year, however, several key suspects had been arrested or tried for war crimes, and the government had adopted a strong anticorruption strategy. These developments <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bolstered\">bolstered</a> hopes that Croatia could join the EU by the end of the decade. Meanwhile, the country’s economy, helped by the spectacular growth of tourism, began to improve. The status of the much-reduced Serb minority also was boosted by the inclusion of an ethnic Serb in the cabinet of the HDZ-led coalition government that came to power in 2008. On April 1, 2009, NATO officially welcomed Croatia as a member of the alliance.","By mid-2009 the outlook was not as promising. Although neighbouring <a href=\"/place/Slovenia\">Slovenia</a>—a member of both NATO and the EU—had agreed to Croatia’s NATO membership, it continued to block Croatian accession negotiations with the EU, claiming that the countries’ ongoing border dispute needed to be resolved first. (The dispute, focused on the maritime border in the Bay of Piran, had originated in 1991 when both countries seceded from Yugoslavia.) Adding to Croatia’s problems, the growing global financial crisis caused the economy to contract sharply during the first half of 2009, and by the end of the year it had suffered a decline of 6 percent of <a href=\"/topic/gross-domestic-product\">gross domestic product</a>. Croatia faced yet another hurdle when Prime Minister Sanader resigned on July 1, 2009. Fellow HDZ member Jadranka Kosor, who had been serving as deputy prime minister, succeeded Sanader. She was the first woman to hold the Croatian prime ministership.","In January 2010 Ivo Josipović, a member of the opposition Social Democratic Party of Croatia (Socijaldemokratska partija Hrvatske; SDP), was elected president. Despite his political differences with the ruling HDZ, he promised to support Prime Minister Kosor’s goals of expediting EU membership talks and fighting corruption. Nevertheless, the relative inexperience of the two new leaders and the jockeying of their parties for advantage in the 2011 parliamentary elections kept their differences in play. The HDZ’s continued emphasis on an exclusively Croatian national identity and history still separated its adherents from many younger urban voters and the remaining Serb minority. Some HDZ supporters, for instance, objected to the public apology that President Josipović made in April 2010 to Bosnia and Herzegovina for Croatia’s role in the warfare there in the early 1990s. Meanwhile, the SDP was drawn into the public’s continued concerns about EU membership when one of the party’s major supporters, a large public employees’ union, objected to labour-related conditions imposed by the EU on prospective members. The objections slowed the full-scale labour reform that would be needed for EU accession. Larger concerns for EU accession, however, remained judicial reform in general and the conclusion of several corruption trials in particular. Still, the fact that both major parties and the respected Croatian National Bank supported membership in the EU was a major advantage in the accession process, which had gained momentum after November 2009, when Slovenia and Croatia agreed to have their border dispute settled by international arbitration.","After more than a decade of effort and six years of formal talks, the accession process reached a final milestone in June 2011, when Croatia closed negotiations with the EU. This accomplishment did little to <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bolster\">bolster</a> public approval of the HDZ, however, as corruption scandals—the most notable involving former prime minister Sanader—bogged down the party throughout the year. Croatia also struggled with the economic <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/malaise\">malaise</a> that had afflicted the rest of Europe, and, like ruling parties across the continent throughout 2011, the HDZ suffered for it at the polls. In the general election on December 4, 2011, the opposition Kukuriku coalition, headed by Zoran Milanović, swept the HDZ from power and claimed an overall majority in parliament, winning 80 of 151 seats. Just days after the election, as Milanović began the work of constructing his government, Croatia signed the accession treaty that would enable it to join the EU in 2013. In a referendum held in January 2012, accession received approval from two-thirds of Croatian voters, but voter turnout, at 43.6 percent, marked the lowest level of participation for any poll on EU entry.

Yet, instead of a reward, the Croats received the same central control and Germanization that were dealt out to the Hungarians as punishment. Reaction against these disappointments encouraged the development of the Party of Right, led by Ante Starčević, which emphasized the idea of Croatian “state rights” and aspired to the creation of an independent Great Croatia. The necessity of relying on the other South Slavs in opposition to the Habsburgs and Hungarians also kept alive the Illyrian idea, revived in the 1860s under the name Yugoslavism.

The internal borders of the country were redrawn, so that historical Croatia was subdivided into several new <em>banovine</em> (provinces) named after rivers and natural features.

In April 1941 Germans and Italians set up the Independent State of Croatia, which also embraced Bosnia and Herzegovina and those parts of Dalmatia that had not been ceded to Italy. Though in fact this state was under occupation by the German and <a href=\"/topic/history-of-Italy\">Italian</a> armies, Pavelić’s Ustaša was put into power—a takeover facilitated by the refusal of Maček to take part in a puppet government and by the passivity of the Roman Catholic archbishop of Zagreb, Alojzije Stepinac. Initially there was enthusiasm for the independent state, but once in power the Ustaša ruthlessly persecuted Serbs, Jews, Roma (Gypsies), and antifascist Croats. The Ustaša planned to eliminate Croatia’s Serb minority partly by conversion from Orthodoxy to Catholicism, partly by expulsion, and partly by extermination. As many as 350,000 to 450,000 victims were killed in Ustaša massacres and in the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/notorious\">notorious</a> <a href=\"/topic/concentration-camp\">concentration camp</a> at Jasenovac.","Sporadic resistance, particularly by Croatia’s Serbs, began almost immediately, but it was the communist <a href=\"/topic/Partisan-Yugoslavian-military-force\">Partisans</a>, under <a href=\"/biography/Josip-Broz-Tito\">Josip Broz Tito</a> (himself a Croat), who provided the resistance with leadership and a program.

Despite his political differences with the ruling HDZ, he promised to support Prime Minister Kosor’s goals of expediting EU membership talks and fighting corruption. Nevertheless, the relative inexperience of the two new leaders and the jockeying of their parties for advantage in the 2011 parliamentary elections kept their differences in play. The HDZ’s continued emphasis on an exclusively Croatian national identity and history still separated its adherents from many younger urban voters and the remaining Serb minority. Some HDZ supporters, for instance, objected to the public apology that President Josipović made in April 2010 to Bosnia and Herzegovina for Croatia’s role in the warfare there in the early 1990s. Meanwhile, the SDP was drawn into the public’s continued concerns about EU membership when one of the party’s major supporters, a large public employees’ union, objected to labour-related conditions imposed by the EU on prospective members. The objections slowed the full-scale labour reform that would be needed for EU accession. Larger concerns for EU accession, however, remained judicial reform in general and the conclusion of several corruption trials in particular. Still, the fact that both major parties and the respected Croatian National Bank supported membership in the EU was a major advantage in the accession process, which had gained momentum after November 2009, when Slovenia and Croatia agreed to have their border dispute settled by international arbitration.","After more than a decade of effort and six years of formal talks, the accession process reached a final milestone in June 2011, when Croatia closed negotiations with the EU. This accomplishment did little to <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bolster\">bolster</a> public approval of the HDZ, however, as corruption scandals—the most notable involving former prime minister Sanader—bogged down the party throughout the year.

Just days after the election, as Milanović began the work of constructing his government, Croatia signed the accession treaty that would enable it to join the EU in 2013. In a referendum held in January 2012, accession received approval from two-thirds of Croatian voters, but voter turnout, at 43.6 percent, marked the lowest level of participation for any poll on EU entry.

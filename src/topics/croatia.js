			`Croatia, country located in the northwestern part of the Balkan Peninsula. It is a small yet highly geographically diverse crescent-shaped country. Its capital is Zagreb, located in the north.`,
			`The present-day republic is composed of the historically Croatian regions of Croatia-Slavonia (located in the upper arm of the country), Istria (centred on the Istrian Peninsula on the northern Adriatic coast), and Dalmatia (corresponding to the coastal strip). Although these regions were ruled for centuries by various foreign powers, they remained firmly Western-oriented in culture, acquiring a legacy of Roman law, the Latin alphabet, and western European political and economic traditions and institutions. A part of Yugoslavia for much of the 20th century, Croatia suffered considerably from the disintegration of that federation in the early 1990s. The European trajectory of Croatia was finally realized in 2013 when it joined the European Union. As the Croatian Canadian scholar Tony Fabijančić writes, Croatia’s tumultuous first years as an independent country also have obscured its centuries-long history:`

				`The upper arm of the Croatian crescent is bordered on the east by the Vojvodina region of Serbia and on the north by Hungary and Slovenia. The body of the crescent forms a long coastal strip along the Adriatic Sea, and the southern tip touches on Montenegro. Within the hollow of the crescent, Croatia shares a long border with Bosnia and Herzegovina, which actually severs a part of southern Croatia from the rest of the country by penetrating to the Adriatic in a narrow corridor.`

						`Croatia is composed of three major geographic regions. In the north and northeast, running the full length of the upper arm of the Croatian crescent, are the Pannonian and para-Pannonian plains. To the north of Zagreb, the Zagorje Hills, fragments of the Julian Alps now covered with vines and orchards, separate the Sava and Drava river valleys.`,
						`To the west and south of the Pannonian region, linking it with the Adriatic coast, is the central mountain belt, itself part of the Dinaric Alps. The karst plateaus of this region, consisting mostly of limestone, are barren at the highest elevations; lower down, they are heavily forested. The highest mountain in Croatia, Dinara (6,007 feet [1,831 metres]), is located in the central mountain belt.`,
						`The third geographic region, the Croatian littoral, is composed of the Istrian Peninsula in the north and the Dalmatian coast extending south to the Gulf of Kotor. Wedged between the Dinaric Alps to the east and the Adriatic Sea to the west, its 1,100 miles (1,800 km) of coastline are fringed by more than 1,100 islands and islets.`

						`Of the 26 rivers that flow for more than 30 miles (50 km) in Croatia, the Sava and the Drava, coursing through the Pannonian and para-Pannonian plains, are of particular importance—both because of their length and because, along with the Kupa River, they are in large part navigable. The Sava originates in Slovenia, passes Croatia’s capital city of Zagreb, and then forms most of the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina along the inside of the Croatian crescent. The Drava enters Croatia from Slovenia and forms all but a small section of the border with Hungary before joining the Danube, which in turn forms most of the border between Croatia and the Vojvodina province of Serbia. The Kupa, which forms part of the frontier between Slovenia and Croatia, and the Una River, which meanders along part of the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, both flow into the Sava. In Dalmatia the Krka and Cetina rivers are of particular importance because of their hydroelectric potential and because they flow into the Adriatic Sea.`,
						`In addition, a great deal of water circulates in underground rivers and pools in the karstic regions of the central mountain belt and the littoral. These waters account for many of the unique geologic formations and the picturesque landscape of central and western Croatia.`

These plains are the most fertile agricultural regions of Croatia and form the country’s breadbasket. The soil of the central mountainous belt is rather poor but offers some cultivable land in the fields and meadows and some grazing land in the plateaus. The Croatian littoral is mostly mountainous and barren, with rocky soil and poor agricultural land.`

						`Two main climatic zones dominate Croatia. The Pannonian and para-Pannonian plains and the mountain regions are characterized by a continental climate of warm summers and cold winters. In the plains, temperatures average in the low 70s F (low 20s C) in June and in the low 30s F (around 0 °C) in January—although they can range from a low of −5 °F (−20 °C) in the winter to a high of 105 °F (40 °C) in the summer. The central mountain regions of Lika and Krbava have slightly cooler summers and cold winters, with a milder climate in the valleys. The average temperature range is between about 65 °F (about 18 °C) in June and the upper 20s F (about −2 °C) in January. Considerable rainfall, turning to snow in winter, is characteristic of the region.`,
						`The Dalmatian coast, Istria, and the islands have a mild Mediterranean climate. In southern Dalmatia, where the sirocco winds (known there as the jugo) bring a moderating influence from Africa, summers are sunny, warm, and dry, and winters are rainy. In the north the winters are drier and colder as a result of the cold northeast wind known as the bora (bura). In the summer the mistral wind has a cooling effect on the coast and the islands. The average temperature ranges from the low 40s F (about 5 °C) in January to the low 70s F (low 20s C) in June. Rainfall is moderate and occurs mainly in the winter.`

On the Dalmatian coast, grapes and olives are grown to produce wine and oil, while Istria is dominated by firs, and Slavonia has many oak forests. In terms of animal life, lizards are found on the coast, while wolves and even bears can be found in the inland forests. Hares, foxes, boars, wildcats, and mouflons (wild sheep) also inhabit Croatia. Sea life in the Adriatic is rich as well, with many coral reefs and underwater caves serving as habitats.`

						`A variety of ethnic groups coexist within the republic. Croats constitute about nine-tenths of the population. Serbs make up the largest minority group; however, their proportion fell dramatically as a result of the 1990s war of independence—from more than one-tenth of the population before the war to less than half that figure in 2001. In addition to the Croats and the Serbs, there are small groups of Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks), Hungarians, Italians, and Slovenes as well as a few thousand Albanians, Austrians, Bulgarians, Czechs, Germans, and other nationalities.`,
						`It has been estimated that the number of Croats living outside the borders of Croatia is comparable to the number living inside the country. Many ethnic Croats reside in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where Croats have lived since the Slavs first migrated to the western Balkan Peninsula in the 6th and 7th centuries CE. Although there has traditionally been a yearning for unification with Croatia among the Croats of Herzegovina (a region contiguous to Dalmatia), this sentiment has not generally been shared by Croats within Croatia or even by Croats in Bosnia. Many of the Serbs in Croatia are descendants of people who migrated to the border areas of the Holy Roman Empire between the 16th and 18th centuries, following the Ottoman conquest of Serbia and Bosnia.`,
						`There is traditionally a close correlation between ethnic identity and religious affiliation. The Croats are overwhelmingly Roman Catholic and more Western-influenced than the Serbs, who are overwhelmingly Eastern Orthodox. A small minority of people are nonreligious or atheist. Bosniaks constitute most of the Muslim population.`

						`Croats speak Croatian, a South Slavic language of the Indo-European family. Croatian is quite similar to Serbian and Bosnian, but political developments since the collapse of Yugoslavia have encouraged the three ethnic groups to emphasize the differences between their languages. The clearest distinction between the Croatian and Serbian variants of what was previously called the Serbo-Croatian language is the script, with Croatian written in the Latin alphabet and Serbian in the Cyrillic. Distinctions of grammar and pronunciation also occur, as do more striking differences in vocabulary, which result partly from differential historical patterns of foreign domination. For Croats, this has resulted in a sprinkling of German, Hungarian, and (in Dalmatia and Istria) Italian vocabulary, while the Serbs’ speech shows Turkish and Russian influences. In addition, there have been various movements to “purify” the Croatian language, which have led to further differences.`,
						`Another linguistic distinction, reflecting the legacies of history as well as the effects of geography, can be heard in the colourful medley of regional dialects and subdialects that survive to this day. The standard Croatian literary language, based on the Shtokavian dialect, emerged in the second half of the 19th century as a result of an effort to unite all South Slavs. Although all three major branches of Serbo-Croatian (Shtokavian, Chakavian, and Kajkavian) were spoken by Croats (as they still are today), the Shtokavian dialect was the most widely heard in Croatian regions of eastern Slavonia, the Adriatic littoral from Makarska to Dubrovnik, and Herzegovina, as well as Montenegro and Serbia. It was therefore adopted by leading Croatian national intellectuals of the 19th century.`

						`More than half of the population resides in urban areas, particularly in the upper arm of the country and along the Adriatic coast. Settlement is relatively sparse in the central mountainous area. While most of Croatia’s Serbs live in urban centres, a significant number are scattered in villages and towns, mostly in lightly populated parts of the central mountain belt, in the regions of Lika and Banija, and in northern Dalmatia. There is also a smaller concentration of Serbs in Slavonia, although this area was particularly hard-hit by anti-Serb ethnic cleansing during the 1991–95 war.`

						`The major demographic trend of the post-World War II period was rapid urbanization and a consequent migration from rural areas—especially from the less-prosperous karstic regions of Lika and Gorski Kotar in the central mountain belt, from Dalmatia, and from islands in the Adriatic but also from the Pannonian regions of Banija and Baranja. As a result, in the second half of the 20th century, the portion of the population employed in agriculture dropped from about two-thirds to less than one-fifth, and larger cities grew significantly; Zagreb, for example, more than doubled its metropolitan population. Parallel to this rapid urbanization was a sharp decrease in the birth rate. A much larger drop in infant mortality meant that Croatia’s population continued to increase—although at a very low rate—until the 1990s, when wartime displacement, emigration, and deaths caused the population to plummet by several hundred thousand. After hitting a plateau in the second half of the ’90s, the population remained at roughly the same level into the 21st century. The many emigrants who left Croatia during the 20th century have created significant diasporas in Canada, the United States, Australia, and other countries. Croatian expatriates have sometimes played an important role in political developments in their homeland.`

			paragraphs: [`Following the demise of communism in Croatia in 1990, the Croatian government began a course of restructuring the economy from the Yugoslav system of socialist self-management to market-oriented capitalism. This required such measures as the sale of state-owned enterprises to private owners, the establishment of functioning markets, and the creation of stable prices, interest rates, and currency. The accomplishment of these tasks proved difficult, largely because of the destabilizing effects of war. The war not only deterred foreign investment, which was a crucial motor of economic growth and structural change in other central and eastern European countries, but also damaged infrastructure and production facilities. By the late 1990s nearly one in five members of the working-age population were jobless, with young people particularly affected; high unemployment remained a problem into the 21st century. The war also helped to foster an informal economy and a black market.`],

						`Agriculture (grazing and tilling) occupies less than one-fourth of Croatia’s land and contributes less than one-tenth of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Most agricultural land is privately held, but many landholdings are too small for profitable production. Croatian agricultural produce is exported mainly to nearby countries, particularly Bosnia and Herzegovina, Italy, Slovenia, and Serbia.`,
						`Slavonia, the granary of Croatia, is the most fertile agricultural region. Farming there is characterized by capital-intensive, market-oriented production and larger landholdings. Most of the land previously under social ownership has been nationalized by the Croatian government and is leased to farmers. Major crops of the region are sugar beets, corn (maize), wheat, potatoes, barley, soybeans, sunflowers, and tobacco. Oats, rye, millet, rice, beans, peas, and chicory are also grown. Pigs, cattle, and poultry are important to the economy of the region, while there is also some beekeeping and silkworm cultivation.`,
						`The hills of the western part of the para-Pannonian region are characterized by smallholdings, mixed farming, and generally low yields. Fruit growing, viticulture, and cattle and pig breeding are typical agricultural occupations.`,
						`The central mountain belt contains some of the poorest land and climate for agriculture. The large areas of meadow and pasture, however, are suitable for raising sheep and cattle, and there is also some cultivation of barley, oats, rye, and potatoes. Fruits grown include plums, apples, pears, sour cherries, sweet cherries, peaches, and apricots.`,
						`The Adriatic littoral of Istria and Dalmatia is characterized by rocky soil and long periods of drought, with small parcels of arable land and poor pasture. Sheep and goats are raised, while grapes, olives, almonds, figs, tangerines, and other Mediterranean fruits and vegetables round out the agriculture of this region. Beekeeping is also of some commercial importance, especially on the islands.`,
						`Croatia’s large forests, covering about two-fifths of the country’s area, form the basis of a wood and pulp industry. Fish and shellfish are harvested commercially in the waters off the Adriatic coast, although fish stocks in the sea declined in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Around nine-tenths of the fish catch comprises small oily fish (e.g., anchovies and pilchards), much of which is consumed locally, but there is also an increasing demand for nonoily fish, or whitefish (e.g., sea bass). Aquaculture, or fish farming, is of growing importance, with sea bass, tuna, and mussels all popular. Almost all commercially sold freshwater fish is raised in ponds as well, though freshwater fishing has some significance for tourism. Farmed fish are exported to countries such as Spain and Japan, while canned fish is sold mainly to surrounding countries.`

						`Deposits of oil and natural gas are found in the Pannonian valleys of eastern Slavonia, but Croatia consumes more oil and gas than it produces and thus is dependent on imports. Bauxite and coal mining had ceased by the early 21st century. Clay, stone, and gravel are still quarried, however, and gypsum and quartz are mined. There are small deposits of other minerals, including salt, throughout the country. Although Croatia’s numerous rivers offer hydroelectric potential, the country imports a significant portion of its electricity.`

						`Already more industrialized than most of its neighbours when the communists assumed power over Yugoslavia in 1945, Croatia continued its rapid industrialization under socialist policies of economic and social development. One unfortunate result was the squandering of a great deal of money through inefficiency and the misallocation of resources through the building of so-called political factories, which served more to enhance the prestige of politicians than to use most rationally the endowments of a specific region. Nevertheless, large investments in industry (as well as transportation and education) ensured the continued growth of that sector and allowed the absorption into an industrial workforce of Croatia’s rapidly urbanizing population. On the eve of Yugoslavia’s disintegration into war in 1991, industry and mining accounted for more than one-third of Croatia’s GDP.`,
						`Today manufacturing and other secondary industries account for a smaller but still important portion of GDP. Significant industries include food processing and wine making, as well as the production and refining of petroleum. Also important are chemical products, building materials, metallurgy (particularly aluminum and iron and steel), the wood and paper industries, machine engineering, electronics, textiles, and shipbuilding. The future of shipbuilding is in question, however, since it is heavily dependent on state subsidies. Most enterprises are concentrated around such urban centres as Zagreb, Rijeka, Split, Osijek, Karlovac, Zadar, Slavonski Brod, Sisak, and Varaždin.`

						`The banking sector has consolidated considerably since the late 1990s, through mergers, takeovers, and bankruptcies. The sector is also now overwhelmingly privately and foreign-owned, with Italian, Austrian, and German banks dominating. Banks in Croatia have invested heavily in technology; hence, Internet, telephone, and drive-in banking are widely offered. Card transactions are the norm in cities. There has been a major expansion in credit since the late 1990s, with consumers eager to borrow money in order to satisfy pent-up demand. The sector is overseen by the Croatian National Bank, the country’s central bank, which earned a good record of achieving price stability in the period after the independence war.`,
						`The Croatian economy is very open to international trade. Nearly two-thirds of trade is conducted with other European Union (EU) countries, while trade with Croatia’s neighbours in southeastern Europe is also significant. Italy, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany, Slovenia, and Austria are top buyers of Croatian exports, while Croatia imports primarily from Italy, Germany, Russia, China, and Slovenia. Important exports include fuels, ships, chemical products, food, machinery, and textiles. Fuels, chemical products, and transport equipment are also among the main imports.`,
						`The service sector employs well over half the workforce and accounts for the majority of GDP. A substantial portion of service workers are employed in retailing. Although the retail market has long been dominated by small shops, newly constructed shopping malls have proliferated since 2000. Croatia’s beautiful coastline and numerous islands form the basis of another major component of the service sector—tourism. A historically important source of revenue, tourism was negatively affected by the war in the 1990s. The conflict deterred potential tourists from traveling to the country, and many empty hotels were used to house refugees and displaced persons. Significant investment has been necessary to revive the tourist industry.`

However, employing people in Croatia is expensive, owing to a combination of relatively high wages, burdensome social security contributions, and the high cost of dismissing workers. The Union of Autonomous Trade Unions of Croatia, founded in 1990, affiliates a number of unions in the country.`,
						`The tax burden on businesses in Croatia is moderate. Under a number of incentive programs, a business may reduce the tax on its profits. Profit tax is reduced, for example, on investments in areas with significant war damage or high unemployment. Income tax is levied on individuals at varying rates. A large part of revenue is raised through a value-added tax, although this tax is reduced for many tourist services and is eliminated for some products, such as books, basic foodstuffs, and certain medical goods.`

Highways run between Zagreb and Split—a route also well served by rail connections—and between Zagreb and the Serbian border. In addition to the direct eastward routes to Serbia and Romania, road access to central Europe is good. However, connections to the south, to Albania and Greece, are cumbersome.`,

Cultural autonomy, along with the right to use one’s own language and script (the latter specifically intended for the Serb minority), is also guaranteed.`,
						`The 1990 constitution changed the structure of the Sabor (parliament) from a tricameral body under the Yugoslav system to a bicameral body consisting of the House of Representatives (lower house) and the House of Districts (upper house). Constitutional amendments in 2001 abolished the upper house, thereby rendering the Sabor a unicameral body. Members are elected from party lists every four years. In addition, a small percentage of seats are reserved for national minorities and for representatives of Croats living outside the country.`,
						`The president of the republic is elected directly by popular vote for a period of five years and is limited to two terms. The 1990 constitution originally granted the president very broad powers; this “superpresident” appointed and could dismiss the prime minister, who was nominally responsible to both the parliament and the president but was actually directly dependent on the president. Constitutional amendments in 2000 reduced the importance of the president, who thenceforth served solely as head of state, and increased the power of the parliament and of the prime minister, who assumed the role of head of government. The president continues to nominate the prime minister, but the Sabor must confirm the appointment. In addition, the prime minister is typically the head of the leading party in the Sabor.`

The HDZ dominated politics in the first years of the post-Yugoslav era, having come to power in the parliamentary elections of 1990. The party leader, Franjo Tudjman, served as the first president of independent Croatia. The HDZ initially based its ideology on Croatian nationalism and the struggle for independence, but it began to lose favour after the war ended in 1995 and the population felt the pain of economic collapse. In 2000, the year after Tudjman died, the HDZ was resoundingly defeated in parliamentary and presidential elections. A multiparty centre-left coalition, led by the SDP, then governed until 2003, when the HDZ, having repositioned itself as a typical centre-right party, returned to power.

The first printed book in the Croatian language was Hrvoje’s Missal, a liturgical text printed in 1483. Among the 20th-century giants in Croatian literature are the much-translated novelist, poet, essayist, dramatist, polemicist, and critic Miroslav Krleža (1893–1981) and the lyric poet, essayist, and translator Tin Ujević (1891–1955), both of whom treated psychological and sociopolitical struggles at individual and universal levels.`,

						`Film enjoys a particularly important place in contemporary Croatian culture. The Zagreb school of film animation has acquired world renown and recognition, including an Academy Award in 1961 for Dušan Vukotić’s animated film The Substitute. Since 1972, Zagreb has periodically hosted an international animated film festival. Acclaimed Croatian filmmakers of the late 20th and early 21st centuries include Dejan Šorak, Krsto Papić, and Zrinko Ogresta.`,
						`Croatians enjoy music of many varieties, ranging from folk to opera, jazz, and rock. In Croatia and among the Croatian diaspora, traditional music featuring the tamburitza, a stringed instrument similar to a mandolin (see also tanbur), has a fervid following. In addition, the traditional kolo dance is still performed at weddings and festivals. Zagreb, Split, and Dubrovnik teem with nightclubs that showcase local musical talent. Tereza Kesovija, arguably Croatia’s most famous singer, first received acclaim in the 1960s as a singer of French chansons. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries Sandra Nasić sang and wrote lyrics for Guano Apes, one of Germany’s most popular rock groups.`

						`Like most Europeans, Croatians are passionate about football (soccer). Since independence, Croatia’s national team, made up largely of players from Zagreb and Split, has performed with great distinction. Basketball is also widely popular, with Croatian club teams winning several European championships. The well-known basketball player Dražen Petrović played for Croatia’s Olympic team in 1992 as well as in the National Basketball Association. Croatian tennis players have performed well in international competitions; in particular, Goran Ivanišević won the men’s Wimbledon championship in 2001.`,
						`Croatian athletes participated on Yugoslavia’s Olympic team from 1948. The independent Republic of Croatia formed a national Olympic committee in 1991, and its athletes competed at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, where its basketball squad earned the silver medal. The country’s greatest Summer Olympics strengths are handball (for which it won gold medals in 1996 and 2004) and weight lifting (one gold in 2000), as well as rowing, water polo, sailing, swimming, and gymnastics. Croatia also has performed well in the Winter Olympics, with Alpine skier Janica Kostelić winning a total of four gold medals in 2002 and 2006 and her brother, Ivica Kostelić, winning silver medals in 2006 and 2010.`,
						`Croatia has a number of national parks and reserves that are popular with hikers and other nature enthusiasts. Plitvička Lakes National Park features an extensive waterfall system. The stunning natural beauty of many of Croatia’s islands is preserved in the national parks of Brijuni, Kornati, and Mljet. The North Velebit, Paklenica, and Risnjak national parks encompass mountainous terrain, while the Krka National Park is centred on the river of the same name.`

						`During the 1990s, the Croatian media appeared to be easily influenced by the political agenda of the government. Although media freedom and independence have progressed significantly since that time, market pressures now may pose a greater threat to media freedom. Several newspapers, based in various cities, focus on politics or business, but a number of the daily papers are tabloids. Croatia’s well-respected independent weekly newspaper, Feral Tribune, closed down in 2008 because of financial problems. The departure of Feral left Nacional, another weekly, as the main source of independent commentary. However, the assassination of its editor in 2008 revived concerns about freedom of the press.`,
						`Television is dominated by the state provider, Croatian Radio-Television (Hrvatska Radiotelevizija; HRT), which derives a good portion of its revenue from a compulsory subscription fee. It has some respected current affairs programs but largely focuses on sports and entertainment. Two significant privately owned channels are Nova TV and RTL; both tend toward sensationalism. In addition to the HRT-run radio networks, there are a few private radio operations.`

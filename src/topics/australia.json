Australia’s capital is <a href=\"/place/Canberra\">Canberra</a>, located in the southeast between the larger and more important economic and cultural centres of <a href=\"/place/Sydney-New-South-Wales\">Sydney</a> and <a href=\"/place/Melbourne-Queensland\">Melbourne</a>.","The Australian mainland extends from west to east for nearly 2,500 miles (4,000 km) and from <a href=\"/place/Cape-York-Peninsula\">Cape York Peninsula</a> in the northeast to <a href=\"/place/Wilsons-Promontory\">Wilsons Promontory</a> in the southeast for nearly 2,000 miles (3,200 km).

In simple physical terms, the age of much of the continent is certainly impressive—most of the rocks providing the foundation of Australian landforms were formed during <a href=\"/science/Precambrian-time\">Precambrian</a> and <a href=\"/science/Paleozoic-Era\">Paleozoic</a> time (some 4.6 billion to 252 million years ago)—but the ages of the cores of all the continents are approximately the same. On the other hand, whereas the landscape history of extensive areas in Europe and <a href=\"/place/North-America\">North America</a> has been profoundly influenced by events and processes that occurred since late in the last Ice Age—roughly the past 25,000 years—in Australia scientists use a more extensive timescale that takes into account the great antiquity of the continent’s landscape.","Australia is the last of lands only in the sense that it was the last continent, apart from Antarctica, to be <a href=\"/topic/non-European-exploration\">explored</a> by Europeans. At least 60,000 years before European explorers sailed into the South Pacific, the first <a href=\"/topic/Australian-Aboriginal\">Aboriginal</a> explorers had arrived from <a href=\"/place/Asia\">Asia</a>, and by 20,000 years ago they had spread throughout the mainland and its chief island outlier, Tasmania. When Captain <a href=\"/biography/Arthur-Phillip\">Arthur Phillip</a> of the British <a href=\"/topic/Royal-Navy\">Royal Navy</a> landed with the First Fleet at <a href=\"/place/Botany-Bay\">Botany Bay</a> in 1788, there may have been between 250,000 and 500,000 Aboriginals, though some estimates are much higher. Largely nomadic hunters and gatherers, the Aboriginals had already transformed the primeval landscape, principally by the use of fire, and, contrary to common European perceptions, they had established <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/robust\">robust</a>, semipermanent settlements in well-favoured localities.","The American-style concept of a national “frontier” moving outward along a line of settlement is also inappropriate. There was, rather, a series of comparatively independent expansions from the margins of the various colonies, which were not joined in an independent federated union until 1901. Frontier <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/metaphors\">metaphors</a> were long employed to suggest the existence of yet another extension of Europe and especially of an outpost of Anglo-Celtic <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture\">culture</a> in the distant “antipodes.”","The most striking characteristics of the vast country are its global isolation, its <a href=\"/science/cyclone-meteorology\">low</a> relief, and the aridity of much of its surface. If, like the English novelist <a href=\"/biography/D-H-Lawrence\">D.H. Lawrence</a>, visitors from the Northern Hemisphere are at first overwhelmed by “the vast, uninhabited land and by the grey charred bush…so phantom-like, so ghostly, with its tall, pale trees and many dead trees, like corpses,” they should remember that to Australians the bush—that sparsely populated Inland or <a href=\"/place/Outback\">Outback</a> beyond the <a href=\"/place/Great-Dividing-Range\">Great Dividing Range</a> of mountains running along the Pacific coast and separating it from the cities in the east—is familiar and evokes <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nostalgia\">nostalgia</a>. It still retains some of the mystical quality it had for the first explorers searching for inland seas and great rivers, and it remains a symbol of Australia’s strength and independence; the Outback poem by <a href=\"/biography/Banjo-Paterson\">A.B. (“Banjo”) Paterson</a>, “<a href=\"/topic/Waltzing-Matilda\">Waltzing Matilda</a>,” is the unofficial <a href=\"/topic/national-anthem\">national anthem</a> of Australia known the world over.","Australia’s isolation from other continents explains much of the singularity of its plant and animal life. Its unique flora and fauna include hundreds of kinds of eucalyptus trees and the only egg-laying mammals on Earth, the <a href=\"/animal/platypus\">platypus</a> and <a href=\"/animal/echidna-monotreme\">echidna</a>. Other plants and animals associated with Australia are various acacias (<em>Acacia pycnantha</em> [golden wattle] is the national flower) and dingoes, kangaroos, koalas, and kookaburras. The <a href=\"/place/Great-Barrier-Reef\">Great Barrier Reef</a>, off the east coast of Queensland, is the greatest mass of coral in the world and one of the world’s foremost tourist attractions. The country’s low relief results from the long and extensive erosive action of the forces of wind, rain, and the heat of the sun during the great periods of <a href=\"/science/geologic-time\">geologic time</a> when the continental mass was elevated well above <a href=\"/science/sea-level\">sea level</a>.","Isolation is also a pronounced characteristic of much of the social landscape beyond the large coastal cities. But an equally significant feature of modern Australian society is the representation of a broad spectrum of <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cultures\">cultures</a> drawn from many lands, a development stemming from immigration that is transforming the strong Anglo-Celtic orientation of Australian culture. Assimilation, of course, is seldom a quick and easy process, and minority rights, multiculturalism, and race-related issues have played a large part in contemporary Australian politics. In the late 1990s these issues sparked a <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conservative\">conservative</a> backlash.","Australia has a federal form of government, with a national government for the Commonwealth of Australia and individual state governments (those of <a href=\"/place/New-South-Wales\">New South Wales</a>, <a href=\"/place/Victoria-state-Australia\">Victoria</a>, <a href=\"/place/Queensland-state-Australia\">Queensland</a>, <a href=\"/place/South-Australia\">South Australia</a>, <a href=\"/place/Western-Australia\">Western Australia</a>, and <a href=\"/place/Tasmania\">Tasmania</a>). Each state has a constitution, and its government exercises a limited <a href=\"/topic/degree-education\">degree</a> of <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sovereignty\">sovereignty</a>. There are also two internal territories: <a href=\"/place/Northern-Territory\">Northern Territory</a>, established as a <a href=\"/topic/Bantustan\">self-governing territory</a> in 1978, and the <a href=\"/place/Australian-Capital-Territory\">Australian Capital Territory</a> (including the city of Canberra), which attained self-governing status in 1988. The federal authorities govern the external territories of <a href=\"/place/Norfolk-Island\">Norfolk Island</a>, the <a href=\"/place/Cocos-Islands\">Cocos (Keeling) Islands</a>, <a href=\"/place/Christmas-Island\">Christmas Island</a>, <a href=\"/place/Ashmore-and-Cartier-Islands\">Ashmore and Cartier islands</a>, the Coral Sea Islands, and <a href=\"/place/Heard-and-McDonald-Islands\">Heard Island and McDonald Islands</a> and claim the <a href=\"/place/Australian-Antarctic-Territory\">Australian Antarctic Territory</a>, an area larger than Australia itself.

Australians are in many respects fortunate in that they do not share their continent—which is only a little smaller than the <a href=\"/place/United-States\">United States</a>—with any other country. Extremely remote from their traditional allies and <a href=\"/topic/market\">trading</a> partners—it is some 12,000 miles (19,000 km) from Australia to <a href=\"/place/United-Kingdom\">Great Britain</a> via the Indian Ocean and the <a href=\"/topic/Suez-Canal\">Suez Canal</a> and about 7,000 miles (11,000 km) across the Pacific Ocean to the west coast of the United States—Australians have become more interested in the proximity of huge potential markets in Asia and in the highly competitive industrialized economies of <a href=\"/place/China\">China</a>, <a href=\"/place/Japan\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"/place/South-Korea\">South Korea</a>, and <a href=\"/place/Taiwan\">Taiwan</a>.

The lines of weakness within the mosaic later guided stresses that pulled the blocks apart or pushed them together. The Proterozoic fold belts that bounded the western and southern sides of the Archean Yilgarn block, for example, became the sites of the <a href=\"/science/continental-margin\">continental margin</a> during seafloor spreading in the Mesozoic, and the fold belts of the Amadeus Transverse Zone in central Australia guided the overthrusting of blocks in the north over those in the south during the late Paleozoic.","Proterozoic Australia was part of the supercontinent of <a href=\"/place/Gondwana-supercontinent\">Gondwanaland</a>, comprising <a href=\"/place/India\">India</a> and the other southern continents, from about 750 million years ago.

At the same time, local uplifts in central Australia shed gravels into the Amadeus Basin. By the mid-<a href=\"/science/Carboniferous-Period\">Carboniferous Period</a> (320 million years ago), central Australia was deformed by folding and thrusting along east-west axes, and eastern Australia was deformed by folding along north-south axes and a subsequent granitoid intrusion that consolidated the Lachlan and Thomson fold belts in an epoch of deformation that concluded the Uluru regime.","Australia had moved to higher latitudes so that the alpine uplands that followed the deformation were covered by the nucleus of a continental ice sheet.

The enormous continental blocks amalgamated into a supercontinent—the so-called Proto-Pangaea—by the end of the Precambrian and then split apart in the early Paleozoic. The landmasses reassembled to form Pangaea between the late Carboniferous (about 315 million years ago) and the Late Jurassic (150 million years ago), after which they began (and have continued) to disperse again. Attending the clustering of the continents in Pangaea were the tectonic effect of reduced turnover of mantle material and the environmental effects of low global sea level, a low concentration of atmospheric <a href=\"/science/carbon-dioxide\">carbon dioxide</a>, and, through the correspondingly weak <a href=\"/science/greenhouse-effect\">greenhouse effect</a>, low retention of heat from the Sun. As a result, Pangaea was prone to glaciation, exemplified by the global glaciations near the end of the Proterozoic (in Australia, the Marinoan glaciation) and Permian (the deposits at the onset of the Innamincka Regime).","The reverse effects are known to occur during the alternate configuration of dispersed continents: the plate-tectonic “motor” turns faster, new rift oceans drive the continental fragments apart, sea level is high and the continents flooded, and a high concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide vented from the mantle retains radiant heat from the Sun. The result is that the continents are prone to be covered by the sea (Australia was flooded during the Cambrian and Ordovician between Proto-Pangaea and Pangaea, and after Pangaea in the Cretaceous) and tend to be warm (even though Australia was located at high latitudes in the Mesozoic, there is no evidence of permanent ice having existed on the continent at that time). It is the Pangaea factor that explains the association of tectonic and environmental effects that characterize the tectonic-climatic regimes of Phanerozoic Australia.

The landmasses reassembled to form Pangaea between the late Carboniferous (about 315 million years ago) and the Late Jurassic (150 million years ago), after which they began (and have continued) to disperse again. Attending the clustering of the continents in Pangaea were the tectonic effect of reduced turnover of mantle material and the environmental effects of low global sea level, a low concentration of atmospheric <a href=\"/science/carbon-dioxide\">carbon dioxide</a>, and, through the correspondingly weak <a href=\"/science/greenhouse-effect\">greenhouse effect</a>, low retention of heat from the Sun. As a result, Pangaea was prone to glaciation, exemplified by the global glaciations near the end of the Proterozoic (in Australia, the Marinoan glaciation) and Permian (the deposits at the onset of the Innamincka Regime).","The reverse effects are known to occur during the alternate configuration of dispersed continents: the plate-tectonic “motor” turns faster, new rift oceans drive the continental fragments apart, sea level is high and the continents flooded, and a high concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide vented from the mantle retains radiant heat from the Sun. The result is that the continents are prone to be covered by the sea (Australia was flooded during the Cambrian and Ordovician between Proto-Pangaea and Pangaea, and after Pangaea in the Cretaceous) and tend to be warm (even though Australia was located at high latitudes in the Mesozoic, there is no evidence of permanent ice having existed on the continent at that time). It is the Pangaea factor that explains the association of tectonic and environmental effects that characterize the tectonic-climatic regimes of Phanerozoic Australia.

The enormous continental blocks amalgamated into a supercontinent—the so-called Proto-Pangaea—by the end of the Precambrian and then split apart in the early Paleozoic. The landmasses reassembled to form Pangaea between the late Carboniferous (about 315 million years ago) and the Late Jurassic (150 million years ago), after which they began (and have continued) to disperse again. Attending the clustering of the continents in Pangaea were the tectonic effect of reduced turnover of mantle material and the environmental effects of low global sea level, a low concentration of atmospheric <a href=\"/science/carbon-dioxide\">carbon dioxide</a>, and, through the correspondingly weak <a href=\"/science/greenhouse-effect\">greenhouse effect</a>, low retention of heat from the Sun. As a result, Pangaea was prone to glaciation, exemplified by the global glaciations near the end of the Proterozoic (in Australia, the Marinoan glaciation) and Permian (the deposits at the onset of the Innamincka Regime).","The reverse effects are known to occur during the alternate configuration of dispersed continents: the plate-tectonic “motor” turns faster, new rift oceans drive the continental fragments apart, sea level is high and the continents flooded, and a high concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide vented from the mantle retains radiant heat from the Sun. The result is that the continents are prone to be covered by the sea (Australia was flooded during the Cambrian and Ordovician between Proto-Pangaea and Pangaea, and after Pangaea in the Cretaceous) and tend to be warm (even though Australia was located at high latitudes in the Mesozoic, there is no evidence of permanent ice having existed on the continent at that time). It is the Pangaea factor that explains the association of tectonic and environmental effects that characterize the tectonic-climatic regimes of Phanerozoic Australia.

In all those areas it is the sandstones and quartzites that underlie the upstanding ridges, the intervening valleys being eroded in siltstones or shales, and in all those areas the pattern in plan of ridge and valley reflects the pattern of folding in the underlying rocks.","In the far southwest, the <a href=\"/place/Darling-Range\">Darling Range</a> forms an upfaulted block underlain mainly by granite but capped by laterite, a reddish, <a href=\"/science/iron-chemical-element\">iron</a>-rich product of weathering rock. The Gawler block, in the southeast, is complex. There are crystalline and <a href=\"/science/sandstone\">sandstone</a> uplands in the east, sandstone plateaus in the northeast, and, in the centre and north, the rounded <a href=\"/place/Gawler-Ranges\">Gawler Ranges</a> built of Precambrian volcanic rocks (those older than 541 million years). Much of <a href=\"/place/Eyre-Peninsula\">Eyre Peninsula</a> is occupied by a rolling plain <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/traversed\">traversed</a> by fixed sand dunes, but in the northwest numerous low isolated granite rocks of spectacular appearance, called <a href=\"/science/inselberg\">inselbergs</a>, stand above the plain. They epitomize the isolated ranges and hills widely developed in the northwest of <a href=\"/place/South-Australia\">South Australia</a>, in the <a href=\"/place/Musgrave-Ranges\">Musgrave</a>, Everard, Birksgate, Mann, and Tomkinson ranges.","The lowlands between those raised blocks also display varied <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/topography\">topography</a>. The so-called <a href=\"/place/Barkly-Tableland\">Barkly Tableland</a> is in reality a high plain of remarkable flatness, partly eroded in <a href=\"/science/Cambrian-Period\">Cambrian</a> sedimentary rocks (those about 485 to 541 million years old) and partly underlain by swamp deposits of <a href=\"/science/Neogene-Period\">Neogene</a> and <a href=\"/science/Paleogene-Period\">Paleogene</a> age (i.e., about 2.6 to 66 million years old). The Nullarbor Plain, a karst area, is approximately coincident with the <a href=\"/place/Eucla-Basin\">Eucla Basin</a>. Its surface is so flat that in one section the Trans-Australian Railway runs absolutely straight for some 300 miles (500 km) as it passes over the region. A vast area of the southwest of <a href=\"/place/Western-Australia\">Western Australia</a> is occupied by an extensive high plain traversed by elongate ribbons encrusted with salt, the desiccated and disrupted remnants of former river courses. The <a href=\"/place/Gibson-Desert\">Gibson Desert</a> consists in large part of a laterite-capped plain, but huge areas of the plains of central and northern Australia are occupied by active sand dunes, and large areas of southern South Australia and Western Australia are covered by fields of fixed dunes.","Actively developing and moving sand ridges occupy the <a href=\"/place/Canning-Basin\">Canning Basin</a>, the <a href=\"/place/Great-Victoria-Desert\">Great Victoria Desert</a>, the Amadeus depression, and large areas of the Arunta-Sturt Complex. The dune fields extend to the east into the <a href=\"/place/Great-Artesian-Basin\">Great Artesian Basin</a>, where the dunes <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constitute\">constitute</a> the well-known <a href=\"/place/Simpson-Desert\">Simpson Desert</a>. Those dune deserts reflect the prevailing aridity of most of Australia, and the dune trend displays a huge swirl around the centre of the continent. Yet, even in the most arid areas, rain falls from time to time, and the rivers run occasionally. Because of the scarcity of vegetation and the common development of impermeable rock layers of various types, runoff in the arid lands tends to be rapid and achieves dramatic and significant results. Hillslopes are scoured and washed bare of weathered debris; streams erode gullies and transport large volumes of sediment from the uplands to the plains; broad, braided river channels are developed; and extensive alluvial plains are formed. It is the alluvium, carried to the lowlands by rivers and deposited on the plains, that is, in large measure, the source of the sand out of which the desert dunes are molded by the wind.","In the far southwest of the shield, and especially in the northern areas, precipitation is sufficient to support a considerable vegetation and is regular enough for streams to flow seasonally. There the work of rivers in shaping the land surface is more obvious and widespread; the landscape consists essentially of valleys and intervening divides, the precise form of each depending on local structure. But in such areas the rate of landscape change is more rapid than in the arid zones.","Many of the landforms of the shield are inherited from the past, when different climatic conditions obtained. Remnants of laterite are widespread in many parts of Australia: the <a href=\"/place/Darling-Range\">Darling Range,</a> the far southwest, the Isa Highlands, and Mueller Range, near Darwin, and the southern <a href=\"/place/Eyre-Peninsula\">Eyre Peninsula</a>. The evidence indicates that during the Paleogene and Neogene periods those areas had been reduced to low relief, and humid tropical climates prevailed, for laterite is at present forming only under such conditions in such areas as <a href=\"/place/Southeast-Asia\">Southeast Asia</a> and the <a href=\"/place/Congo-River\">Congo River</a> basin. The disrupted former drainage system of southwest Western Australia has already been referred to, and remnants of similar old stream networks occur in the Amadeus depression, on the <a href=\"/place/Nullarbor-Plain\">Nullarbor Plain</a>, and in the <a href=\"/place/Great-Victoria-Desert\">Great Victoria Desert</a>. A large <a href=\"/science/swamp\">swamp</a> formerly occupied the south of the <a href=\"/place/Barkly-Tableland\">Barkly Tableland</a>; and Lake Woods, near <a href=\"/place/Newcastle-New-South-Wales\">Newcastle</a> Waters, is now dry, with a bed of some 70 square miles (180 square km) in extent, but shorelines indicate that the lake formerly occupied some 1,100 square miles (2,850 square km). <a href=\"/science/fossil\">Fossil</a> remains also suggest wetter climates in the past in many parts of Australia and subsequent deterioration toward aridity. But in the south the occurrence of dunes now fixed by vegetation shows that the climate there has recently become moister.","Finally, in several parts of the shield remnants of eroded surfaces, planed off and covered with hard, silicified crusts of weathered rock, cut across local bedrock and are either preserved high in the relief or buried beneath later sedimentary deposits. They attest to changes in the disposition of the land surface (either base-level changes or regional warping or faulting) and also indicate that, in the past, surfaces of low relief similar to present ones were widely developed. Reference has already been made to the distribution of the laterite surface. At the eastern margin of the shield there are remnants of a still older surface, of middle or late <a href=\"/science/Mesozoic-Era\">Mesozoic</a> age (i.e., formed about 175 to 66 million years ago), which has been warped by subsequent earth movements and now disappears beneath the sediments of the Great Artesian and similar basins. Other evidence of the existence of that surface has been found in northwestern Queensland, central Australia, and South Australia.","On the southeastern extremity of the shield, the <a href=\"/place/Flinders-Ranges\">Flinders</a>–Mount Lofty ranges occupy the site of the Adelaide downwarp in the Earth’s surface. The sediments were folded and faulted, principally in the early Paleozoic (about 540 million years ago), though recurrently since. The <a href=\"/place/Flinders-Ranges\">Flinders Ranges</a> are a much-eroded fold mountain belt characterized by ridge and valley forms in which sandstone ridges and bluffs are dominant. The Willochra Plain occupies an elongate intermontane basin excavated from a major upwarped structure and achieved through the <a href=\"/science/erosion-geology\">erosion</a> of some 20,000 feet (6,000 metres) of sediments. There are remnants of old land surfaces of low relief, and, in the north, extremely rugged relief developed on a much-shattered granite outcrop.","To the south, the <a href=\"/place/Mount-Lofty-Ranges\">Mount Lofty Range</a> is a faulted and much dissected and complex horst, or ancient uplifted structural block. Bounded on both east and west by meridional or gently arcuate fault scarps, which developed initially in the Early Paleozoic but which have suffered recurrent movements since (and which indeed are still active), the ranges are surmounted in many areas by the remnants of a lateritic plain. In many other areas, such a hard capping of rock, if ever present, has been eliminated by stream erosion. Sandstones again form prominent ridges and residuals (isolated relief features), such as Mount Lofty itself; small granite outcrops give rise to boulder-strewn surfaces; and exposures of gneiss form slablike blocks known as tombstones, monk stones, or penitent rocks.","Between the Mount Lofty and the Flinders ranges is a region of broad simple folds in which the sandstone ridges run for the most part north-south and in which the broad open valleys were in some instances occupied by lakes during the Paleogene and Neogene periods. To the northeast, similar upland areas of low relief, but with domes of <a href=\"/science/crystalline-rock\">crystalline rock</a> standing above the general level, dominate the Olary Spur."],"sections":[],"isFilled":true},{"level":3,"id":"ref44999","sidebarHeader":"The Interior Lowlands","header":"The Interior Lowlands","paragraphs":["The <a href=\"/place/Interior-Lowlands-region-North-America\">Interior Lowlands</a> are dominated by three major basins, the Carpentaria Basin, the <a href=\"/place/Eyre-Basin\">Eyre Basin</a>, and the Murray Basin. The Carpentaria and Eyre basins are separated by such minute residual relief elements as Mount Brown and Mount Fort <a href=\"/place/Bowen\">Bowen</a> in northwestern Queensland. The Wilcannia <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/threshold\">threshold</a> divides the Eyre and Murray basins, and the latter is separated from the Otway Basin and the Southern Ocean by the Padthaway Ridge. The Eyre and Murray basins are entirely terrestrial, but the Carpentaria is partly inundated by the sea.","The Carpentaria plains, occupying the basin of the same name, form a narrow lowland corridor between the Isa Highlands and the Einasleigh uplands (part of the Eastern Uplands). They are drained by the Leichhardt, Flinders, and Gilbert rivers and in the south take the form of broadly rolling plains underlain by heavy gray lime-enriched (pedocalic) soils. In the north, however, there are extensive flat depositional plains, some of them related to swamps from the <a href=\"/science/Pleistocene-Epoch\">Pleistocene Epoch</a> (i.e., about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago), some associated with the present floodplains of the braided river systems. Standing above the plains, for example around Normanton, are considerable plateau and mesa remnants of the Paleogene and Neogene laterite surface.","Similar rolling plains with laterite residuals standing above them occur in the Eyre Basin, particularly around the headwaters of the <a href=\"/place/Diamantina-River\">Diamantina</a>, near Kynuna. But to the south, toward the more arid interior, the plains become flatter and are protected by a veneer of stones—the well-known stony desert with its mantle of gibber (hammada, serir, and desert armour). In many parts of southwestern Queensland, northeastern South Australia, and northwestern New South Wales, there are plateau and related relief remnants similar to those found in other parts of the lowlands, although those are capped and protected not by laterite but by silcrete, another hard rock residue. That region is folded in places, and the subsequent dissection by erosive forces has brought about disintegration of the silcrete, which is about 20 million years old and which formerly extended over vast areas of central Australia. That process provided much stony debris for the gibber plains so characteristic of much of central Australia and particularly of the <a href=\"/place/Lake-Eyre\">Lake Eyre</a> depression.","The <a href=\"/science/drainage-basin\">catchment area</a> of Lake Eyre extends over some 500,000 square miles (1,295,000 square km) of central and northern Australia. It occupies the lowest point of the Australian continent (about 50 feet [15 metres] below sea level), and many large river systems drain into it. The rivers drain the driest part of the continent. But no desert is rainless, and floodwaters entirely cover the bed of Lake Eyre about twice each century, the waters deriving not only from central Australia but also from the higher-rainfall areas drained by the headwaters of the Georgina, Diamantina, Thomson, Barcoo, and similar rivers. It is now clear that, during the late Pleistocene, the precipitation of central Australia was heavier than it is now. The interior drainage basin has received vast quantities of sediment and salt by those rivers, past and present. That has provided ample source material for the Simpson Desert dunes, and many of the normally <a href=\"/science/playa\">dry lake</a> beds, including all the large ones, are encrusted with salt. Most of the largest salinas, or salt pans (Eyre, Frome, Torrens, Gregory, and Blanche), are, at least in part, of structural origin, having been formed by downfaulted blocks. Torrens and Gregory are surfaced mainly by gypsum, but the remainder carry a crust of <a href=\"/science/salt\">sodium chloride</a>, common salt. Around the major salinas there are extensive alluvial plains.","Under the prevailing arid conditions, fine dust is winnowed from the surface sediments and can be carried high into the air in dust storms. Some is carried long distances, even reaching New Zealand from time to time. The sand of the alluvium is molded into dune ridges.","<a href=\"/science/sand-dune\">Sand dunes</a> also occupy large areas of the Murray River basin. They are, by contrast, fixed (or “fossil”) dunes, which developed at some time in the recent past and have since been stabilized by higher precipitation conditions. The eastern part of the basin, near the foothills of the Eastern Uplands, shows evidence of those former higher precipitation amounts in the numerous abandoned river channels of the <a href=\"/place/Riverina\">Riverina</a>. But the western Murray plains are a stony as well as a climatic desert. The plains are underlain by limestones of Miocene age (those about 23 to 5.3 million years old) and, in many areas, by calcrete, a calcareous soil accumulation. Instances of water-dissolved sinkholes and enclosed depressions can be found, and there is a lack of surface drainage characteristic of that type of topography. Only the Murray River, which originates outside the area in a different <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environment\">environment</a>, crosses the basin, flowing in a narrow trench in its lower reaches.","In the east of that region there are extensive alluvial plains associated with major tributaries of the Murray. One feature of interest is the diversion of the Murray, near <a href=\"/place/Echuca\">Echuca</a>, by a rising structural block bounded by fault zones and known as the Cadell Fault Block."],"sections":[],"isFilled":true},{"level":3,"id":"ref45000","sidebarHeader":"The Eastern Uplands","header":"The Eastern Uplands","paragraphs":["The Eastern Uplands are a complex series of high ridges, high plains, plateaus, and basins that extend from <a href=\"/place/Cape-York-Peninsula\">Cape York Peninsula</a> in the north to <a href=\"/place/Bass-Strait\">Bass Strait</a> in the south, with a southerly extension into Tasmania and one extending westward into western Victoria. The uplands are the eroded remnants of an ancient mountain range recently rejuvenated by block faulting. They occupy the site of the Tasman downwarp belt, the sediments of which were folded and faulted in late Paleozoic times. Granite batholiths were intruded into that region, and during the <a href=\"/science/Cenozoic-Era\">Cenozoic Era</a> (the past 66 million years) <a href=\"/science/lava-volcanic-ejecta\">lavas</a> appeared extensively in areas as far apart as northern Queensland and Tasmania. Characteristic features associated with that process were lava fields, with stony rises, soil-filled depressions, and lava caves. Extinct cones and craters survive in southeastern Queensland, in the Monaro district of New South Wales, and in western Victoria.","In considerable measure the <a href=\"/science/continental-landform\">landforms</a> reflect the various geologic events. Uplifted structural blocks, many of them trending north to south, are common in some areas, while straight river courses reflect the control exercised by fault zones. Ridge and valley forms, as found in the <a href=\"/place/Grampians\">Grampians</a> of Victoria, reflect the differential erosion of broken and folded rock strata. Massive domes or clusters of boulders are common on the exposed granitic batholiths. The lava plains and plateaus display stony rises, shallow alluvial depressions, and volcanic vents and plugs of various types and ages.","Other features reflect the erosional history of the region. Wide areas of the upland had been reduced to a uniform low relief by the time of the later <a href=\"/science/Mesozoic-Era\">Mesozoic Era</a> (about 100 million years ago) and many remnants of the ancient surface, exhumed by erosive action from beneath a later Cretaceous cover (i.e., up to about 65 million years ago), survive in the landscape, notably in northern Queensland. The Cenozoic leaching of rocks by weathering in humid climates—which forms iron-rich residuals (laterization)—also affected the uplands, from northern Queensland to Tasmania.","Lastly, during the Pleistocene, small <a href=\"/science/glaciation\">glaciers</a> developed in the Mount Kosciuszko area of New South Wales and the central plateau of Tasmania. Small, ice-scoured hollows and small moraines (ridges of glacial debris) attest to those events, while over rather wider areas frost-shattered rocks that subsequently caused soils to flow down-slope (solifluction) have helped shape the surface.

Little more than one-tenth of the continent receives more than 40 inches (1,000 mm) per year. As has been noted, in winter the snowfields of Tasmania and the Mount Kosciuszko area can be extensive, but on the whole Australia is an extremely hot country, in consequence of which evaporation losses are high and the effectiveness of the rainfall received is reduced. In addition, the severity of climate, the predominance of the outdoors in the minds and lives of many, and the national importance of agricultural and pastoral pursuits all make Australians perhaps more climate-conscious than most. In no country of comparable development do climate and weather loom so large in the lives and conversation of the people.","The principal features of Australia’s climate stem from its position, shape, and size. Australia is mainly a compact tropical and near-tropical continent. No major arms or embayments of the sea penetrate far into the landmass. The only extensive uplands occur near the east coast, and even they are not, by world standards, very high.","In summer (December–February), when the sun is directly overhead in northern Australia, temperatures are extremely high. The sea exerts little moderating influence, and the uplands are not sufficiently extensive or high to have more than local effects. Temperatures commonly soar above the 100 °F (38 °C) mark in the interior, but because there rarely is any cloud cover, radiation loss is considerable at night, and daily temperature ranges are wide. High temperatures dominate the Australian summers in all but Tasmania. Heat waves are common, and, though the highest amounts of <a href=\"/science/solar-radiation\">solar radiation</a> are received in northern South Australia, the highest temperatures and longest heat waves are recorded in the northwest of Western Australia.

Temperatures in winter remain moderate except in the uplands of Tasmania and southeastern Australia, where snow is common. Night frosts are common in winter throughout southern Australia and in the interior.","Because of its relatively low latitudinal position, Australia comes under the influence of the southeast trade winds in the north and the westerlies in the south. Northern Australia is affected by a northerly <a href=\"/science/monsoon\">monsoon</a>, partly because of the <a href=\"/science/latitude\">latitude</a> and the seasonal migration of planetary wind zones and partly because of the summer heating of the continental interior that draws in surface winds.

The principal aim of the strategy was to ensure that the frogs survived in the wild by collecting eggs from their natural habitat and by increasing the number of eggs laid in captivity.","The federal and state governments partnered with organizations and landowners to help protect biodiversity “hotspots.” By 2017 the government had identified 15 of these large regions with a high <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diversity\">diversity</a> of native species that are not found, or are only rarely found, anywhere else in the world. One of the most significant of these hotspots, the Tasmanian Midlands, is home to more than 180 rare and threatened plant and animal species, including the <a href=\"/animal/Tasmanian-devil\">Tasmanian devil</a>, the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle (<em>Aquila audax fleayi</em>), and the Eastern (or Tasmanian) bettong (Tasmanian <a href=\"/animal/rat-kangaroo\">rat kangaroo</a> [<em>Bettongia gaimardi</em>]).

The Western Australian government’s Kimberley Science and Conservation Strategy provided funding for scientific research that supports the management of these protected areas and for the creation of new parks jointly managed by Aboriginal groups. Among the land management practices employed is <a href=\"/science/prescribed-fire\">controlled burning</a> along with feral animal and weed control.","The creation of programs and reserves such as these was an important step toward safeguarding some of the continent’s most pristine areas, although, given the range of ecosystems in Australia, such efforts scarcely have been enough to check the ongoing loss of diversity overall.","Legislation requiring preparatory environmental impact statements became standard for most types of development during the early 1970s. Conservationist organizations interested in protecting fauna and flora are well developed in Australia, and environmental protection is also served by related National Trust bodies whose main concern has been with the built environment of towns, cities, and historic rural landscapes.

Updated knowledge about those plants comes mainly from such institutions and reaches the public through published handbooks, called floras, listing and illustrating the species. The number of general popular books dealing with the ornamental, horticultural, medicinal, culinary, and other uses of plants increased sharply following the publication of a major new flora, the multivolume series <em>Flora of Australia</em> (1981– ).","Australia’s phanerogamian (seed plant) <a href=\"/topic/Flora-Roman-mythology\">flora</a> of approximately 20,000 species is thought to have arisen in ancient times from two distinct intakes of stock. Both stocks had previously been involved in a wider theatre, and each intake was followed by a period when the species adapted and diversified within the continent. The great advances in geophysics toward understanding continental drift have made it possible to take the paleontological and related botanical evidence and reconstruct the physical environment and time-sequence.","Australia’s initial intake of flora originated—as was the case with present-day <a href=\"/place/South-America\">South America</a>, <a href=\"/place/Africa\">Africa</a>, <a href=\"/place/India\">India</a>, <a href=\"/place/Madagascar\">Madagascar</a>, <a href=\"/place/New-Caledonia-French-unique-collectivity-Pacific-Ocean\">New Caledonia</a>, <a href=\"/place/New-Zealand\">New Zealand</a>, and <a href=\"/place/Antarctica\">Antarctica</a>—during the period when it was part of <a href=\"/place/Gondwana-historical-region-India\">Gondwana</a>. Hence, much Gondwanan flora is still shared among the now-separated lands, both at present and in the <a href=\"/science/fossil-record\">fossil record</a>, including, for example, the southern beech (also called the Antarctic, or myrtle, beech), the conifer families Podocarpaceae and Araucariaceae, and many angiosperm families (e.g., Myrtaceae, Proteaceae, and Stylidiaceae).","Australia also shares many groups of plants with the Malesian region (the <a href=\"/place/Malay-Archipelago\">Malay Archipelago</a>) to the north. That is considered to be the result of a second, two-way exchange much later in geologic history, in the <a href=\"/science/Miocene-Epoch\">Miocene Epoch</a>, when continental drift eventually brought Australia into close proximity with the Malesian region.

Of the family Epacridaceae, <em>Leucopogon</em> extends to <a href=\"/place/Malaysia\">Malaysia</a> and <a href=\"/place/Thailand\">Thailand</a>, and <em>Trochocarpa</em> to Borneo and Celebes (Sulawesi). Conversely, more than 200 genera of plants best known from the Malesian region or northward are represented in Australia (mainly northern Australia), each by a single species not confined to Australia. Those are comparatively recent arrivals from the north.","The characteristic part of Australia’s plant life that is little shared with other lands, together with those specialized characteristics that apparently originated on the continent long ago, form what has been designated as an Australian (or autochthonous) element. It includes many of the plants that are distinctive to typical Australian vegetation scenery and shows a marked tendency to sclerophylly (formation of hard leaves). Speculation has linked sclerophylly with low soil nutrient levels. Australia ranks lowest among the continents for soil fertility. Many genera include various species, each adapted to different <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environments\">environments</a> across the entire range of the continent’s habitats.","The Australian element includes derivatives of Gondwanan stock channeled specially to Australia, at the family level (for example, Epacridaceae, Myoporaceae, Goodeniaceae, and Stackhousiaceae), together with typically Australian developments within nonendemic families—for example, subfamily Leptospermoideae of Myrtaceae, the genera <em>Banksia</em> and <em>Hakea</em> of Proteaceae, the grass trees and blackboys (family Xanthorrhoeaceae, separated from Liliaceae), and the kangaroo paws (family Haemodoraceae).","Most obvious to the visitor is <em></em>, which is represented by more than 400 species, ranging in size from diminutive mallees, smaller than a person, to forest giants matching in bulk and height the world’s largest plants.

There is no standard, or worldwide, classification system (such as exists for describing flora) for that aspect of the environment. Initial attempts to apply European and American classification concepts to Australia were not particularly satisfactory, because of the peculiarities of the continent’s vegetation and environment. For example, climatic control of local vegetation zones was often found insufficient to explain vegetation changes; on the contrary, soil patterns and geologic history quite override climatic control in many localities. Similarly, structural descriptive schemes useful for Northern Hemisphere coniferous and deciduous vegetation proved inappropriate when confronted by the great variety of evergreen vegetation—notably mallees and shrubs—found in Australia. The mapping of Australian vegetation is based largely on factual descriptive features, and by that means <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/comprehensive\">comprehensive</a> and detailed accounts and maps have been produced.","Australian plant life is distributed in three main zones—the Tropical, Temperate, and Eremian—a pattern that reflects overall climatic conditions. The <a href=\"/science/tropical-zone\">Tropical Zone</a>, which arcs east and west across the northern margin of the <a href=\"/science/continent\">continent</a> and extends halfway down the eastern seaboard, has a mainly dry monsoonal climate, with some wet regions. The <a href=\"/science/temperate-zone\">Temperate Zone</a>, with a cool-to-warm (temperate-to-subtropical) climate and precipitation mostly in winter, is arced across the southern margin, embracing Tasmania and extending up the eastern seaboard to overlap slightly with the Tropical Zone. The Eremian Zone covers the whole of central Australia through to the west-central coast; its climate is arid.","The major structural units <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constituting\">constituting</a> the geographic distribution are rainforest, sclerophyll forest (dominated by hard-leaved plants such as eucalypts), and woodland, scrub, savanna, and grassland forms, each with a range of subforms. The bulk of the Tropical Zone <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/comprises\">comprises</a> mixed deciduous woodland and sclerophyllous low-tree savanna, with areas of tussock grassland, coastal mangrove complexes, and <a href=\"/science/tropical-rainforest\">tropical rainforest</a> containing much exotic vegetation—particularly in the northeastern parts of Cape York Peninsula and in Queensland. A strong Malesian influence occurs throughout the entire zone. The rainforests—characterized by large trees with stem buttresses and by multiple vegetation layers with interlaced canopies of <a href=\"/plant/liana\">lianas</a> and <a href=\"/plant/epiphyte\">epiphytes</a> growing in the trees—fit the popular concept of “jungle.”","The Temperate Zone is characterized by dry and wet sclerophyllous forests, temperate mixed woodlands, savanna woodlands, mallees, and scrubs, with areas of alpine vegetational complexes, temperate rainforest, and sclerophyllous heath. A much higher proportion of the vegetation cover is typically and recognizably “Australian.” Within that zone the southwestern corner of Western Australia is outstanding, both for the high proportion of Australian plants and for the richness of the plant life, while the vegetation of Tasmania is notable for its forests of southern beech and for its botanical links with New Zealand and South America. In marked contrast to the tropical rainforests, the predominant trees throughout most of the Temperate Zone <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/communities\">communities</a> are either <em>Eucalyptus</em> or <em>Acacia</em>. Much of the Temperate Zone vegetation has been cleared for agricultural purposes, leaving only the vegetation communities of infertile or inaccessible localities.","The vegetation of the Eremian Zone ranges from barely vegetated desert and hills through a variety of semiarid shrub savannas, shrub steppes, semiarid tussock grasslands, and sclerophyllous hummock grasslands. Many shrubs have adapted themselves similarly to the arid conditions, so that in their vegetative state many representatives of different families look alike. <em>Acacia</em>, <em>Eremophila</em>, and <em>Casuarina</em> are examples of genera that tend to displace <em>Eucalyptus</em> as the dominant tree or shrub.

Australia probably has between 200,000 and 300,000 species, about 100,000 of which have been described. There are some 250 species of native mammals, 550 species of land and aquatic birds, 680 species of reptiles, 190 species of frogs, and more than 2,000 species of marine and freshwater fish. The remainder are invertebrates, including insects.","In the varied environments of the Tropical Zone, species confined to the rainforests of the mountainous northeast include the tree <a href=\"/animal/kangaroo\">kangaroos</a> (genus <em>Dendrolagus</em>) and the gorgeous bird-wing butterflies (<em>Ornithoptera</em>). Others favour more open habitats such as savannas and grasslands. Among that group are the agile <a href=\"/animal/wallaby\">wallaby</a> (<em>Macropus agilis</em>) and <em>Amitermes meridionalis</em>, a termite that orients its mounds in a north-south direction by sensing <a href=\"/science/geomagnetic-field\">Earth’s magnetic field</a>.","The animals of the Eremian Zone are characterized by their ability to survive under extremely arid conditions and irregular rainfall. Examples include the <a href=\"/animal/marsupial-mole\">marsupial mole</a> (<em>Notoryctes typhlops</em>), a burrower in sand, and the water-holding frog of the genus <em>Cyclorana</em>. After rainy spells <em>Cyclorana</em> burrows deep in the soil, forming a chamber in which it lies in a cocoonlike sac filled with water formed from a special outer layer of its skin. The budgerigar (<em>Melopsittacus</em>) is adapted to irregular rainfall by being nomadic.","The <a href=\"/science/faunal-region\">fauna</a> of the eucalyptus forests and other habitats of the Temperate Zone contains animals whose life cycles rely on regular winter rainfall. Many are highly adapted to the eucalyptus forests. The <a href=\"/animal/koala\">koala</a> depends on the foliage of just a few species of forest eucalyptus. Lyrebirds and gray kangaroos are forest dwellers. Gray kangaroos also range into semiarid shrublands and heaths. The only Australian alpine animals occur in the high mountains of the Temperate Zone. They include the mountain pygmy possum (genus <em>Burramys</em>) and the alpine grasshopper (<em>Kosciuscola</em>).","Some species occur in all zones. They include the galah (<em>Cacatua roseicapilla</em>; a species of cockatoo) and the Australian magpie (<em>Gymnorhina tibicen</em>).","Extinction of native species is a matter of much concern. Some 20 mammal, 20 bird, and 70 <a href=\"/plant/angiosperm\">flowering plant</a> species are presumed to have become extinct during the period of European settlement. Some 50 terrestrial mammals and more than 1,000 flowering plants are officially listed as both <a href=\"/science/endangered-species\">endangered</a> or vulnerable; that description is also applied to about 30 amphibians, 50 reptiles, and 50 birds. Estimates of the numbers of introduced species include 1,500 to 2,000 flowering plants, 30 freshwater and marine fish, and about 70 land animals and birds. There has also been a great reduction of range of most species inhabiting temperate or semiarid lands, except for those that have benefited from the extension of pastures and watering points. The latter species include the large kangaroos and the Australian magpie.","The high <a href=\"/topic/degree-education\">degree</a> to which many species depend on a relatively narrow range of vegetation types means that animals of some zones have suffered more from human activity than others. Small and medium-size terrestrial mammals and ground-nesting birds of temperate and semiarid grasslands and shrublands have been most affected by clearing for pastures and cereal crops. In addition, they have suffered most from competition with and habitat destruction by introduced animals such as rabbits, sheep, goats, and cattle and from predation by the foxes and feral cats. Few parts of Australia are free from the effects of introduced animal species. In the tropical north the cane toad (<em>Bufo marinus</em>) is believed to be a major predator of small native vertebrates. Even the introduced honeybee, which is widely established in the feral state, is suspected of affecting native nectar-feeding insects, mammals, and birds.","The role of <a href=\"/topic/Australian-Aboriginal\">Aboriginal</a> people in causing the extinction of fauna before European settlement has been much debated. It is clear that at the time of European settlement Aboriginal hunting and burning had major effects on animal numbers, but a balance seems to have been maintained, possibly assisted by a system of social prohibitions that protected important species under certain conditions. But the effect of the initial Aboriginal entry on the continent is not yet clear. At that time, at least 60,000 years ago, the fauna contained many species of large animals (the Australian megafauna) and was considerably different from the fauna present at the time of European settlement. Such megafaunal animals as the rhinoceros-sized <em>Diprotodon</em>, giant wombats, the giant short-faced kangaroos (<em>Sthenurus</em> and <em>Procoptodon</em>), the so-called <a href=\"/animal/marsupial\">marsupial</a> lion <em>Thylacoleo</em>, and giant flightless birds called mihirungs or <em>Genyornis</em> probably became extinct over a period between 27,000 and 12,000 years ago, possibly as late as 6,000 years ago.","It has been argued that Aboriginal overhunting, together with environmental changes caused by associated Aboriginal burning of the country, caused the extinction of those species. Others have suggested that climatic fluctuations at the end of the Pleistocene (some 11,700 years ago) were a more likely cause. Certainly, although there were no extensive ice sheets in Australia, the last glacial maximum (between 22,000 and 18,000 years ago) was a time of highly arid, as well as cold and windy, conditions. Deserts reached their greatest extent at that time, and there is no doubt that under such conditions the fauna (as well as humans) would have been under considerable physiological stress. No clear <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consensus\">consensus</a> has emerged, and, in view of the facts that there is no evidence of a sudden mass extinction and that Aboriginal people seem to have occupied most of Australia for at least 20,000 years before the last megafauna disappeared, it is likely that a combination of all those factors played a part. By about 20,000 years ago, few mammals had survived that weighed more than their human predators.","Commercial hunting of only a few species of native fauna is allowed. It is confined to several species of the kangaroo family, muttonbirds (<em>Puffinus tenuirostris</em>), and some of the most common cockatoos and parrots; however, federal law does not permit live birds to be exported. Permits can be obtained to destroy pest species (such as kangaroos in certain circumstances). Sport shooting of game birds (ducks, quail, and snipes) and a few mammals is permitted in some states. Before controls were established, the numbers of several attractive varieties of parrots and cockatoos—as well as of crocodiles and such mammals as koalas, brushtail possums, ringtail possums, many wallaby species, and seals—reduced dramatically. Most have recovered, however. Quotas are set for the commercial taking of kangaroos each year for hides and for human and pet food. Numbers of kangaroos are constantly monitored, and there is no evidence of any reduction in the wild populations. Hundreds of thousands of muttonbirds are taken yearly for human consumption.","Fauna authorities and scientists responsible for conserving kangaroos support such commercial exploitation on scientific grounds. Many also believe that it would be in the interest of both conservation and agricultural practice to encourage husbandry of kangaroos. However, many others, both in Australia and elsewhere, are vehemently opposed to killing kangaroos for any reason. The issue has become highly political.","Australia has its share of potentially dangerous, as well as commercially useful, animals. The large saltwater crocodile (<em>Crocodilus porosus</em>) is known to eat humans. Of the many poisonous elapid snakes, the most dangerous to humans include taipans (<em>Oxyuranus</em>), smooth snakes (<em>Parademansia</em>), tiger snakes (<em>Notechis</em>), brown snakes (<em>Pseudonaja</em>), and death adders (<em>Acanthophis</em>); the latter, although smaller than the others, have large fangs, a lightning-fast strike, and highly toxic venom. About one-seventh of Australia’s snake species pose a deadly threat to humans. There are many poisonous spiders, the best-known being the <a href=\"/animal/funnel-web-spider\">funnel-web spider</a> (<em>Atrax</em>) and the red-back (<em>Latrodectus</em>). Both of those have caused human deaths, but only a minute proportion of Australia’s spiders are dangerous. Antivenins are available for the venoms of both spiders and snakes.","Ticks and internal parasitic worms are mainly harmful to stock and domestic pets, and some blood-sucking insects are disease carriers. The larvae of the sheep blowfly <em>Lucilia</em> attack sheep and cause losses worth millions of dollars to the wool industry. Locusts, weevils, and insect larvae of various sorts do great damage in agriculture.","The Australian fauna (and that of New Guinea, which is part of the Australian lithospheric plate) is markedly different from that of the other adjacent land areas (Indonesia and other nearby islands). It is now known that the difference stems from Australia’s long isolation and northward drift into its present geographic position. Thus, the Australian fauna has been derived to a large degree from the lands with which Australia was in contact when it was part of Gondwana. That part of the fauna derived from Asia, which includes the only <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/extant\">extant</a> native placental mammals (rats, mice, bats, and the dingo—the latter probably introduced by Aboriginal people), entered Australia by island-hopping or accidental drifting. As might be expected, flying animals of Asian origin (e.g., bats and birds) reached Australia before the others, and they may have done so soon after Australia separated from Antarctica. Horseshoe bats (family Hipposideridae), which are related to typical Old World forms, appear in the Australian fossil record about 20 million years before the present.","The Gondwanan component gives the Australian fauna its distinctive character. As is the case in South America, Australia has many species of marsupials, but they radiated more widely in Australia than in South America, coming to occupy virtually all mammalian adaptive <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/niches\">niches</a>. Thus, there are marsupial equivalents of moles, anteaters, wolves, flying possums, and antelopes. The only egg-laying <a href=\"/animal/mammal\">mammals</a> in the world—the <a href=\"/animal/platypus\">platypus</a> (genus <em>Ornithorhynchus</em>) and the <a href=\"/animal/echidna-monotreme\">echidna</a> (<em>Tachyglossus</em>); also the <a href=\"/place/New-Guinea\">New Guinea</a> long-beaked echidna (<em>Zaglossus</em>)—are Gondwanan as well, but the oldest related fossil is from the Early <a href=\"/science/Cretaceous-Period\">Cretaceous</a> of central Australia and predates the separation of India from Australia. Until recently it was assumed that placental mammals had not occurred in Australia until they emigrated southward from Asia. Nor was there evidence of distinctively Australian mammal fossils in South America. In 1991, however, the Australian paleontologists Michael Archer, Henk Godthelp, and Suzanne Hand reported finding bats of early Eocene origin (about 55 million years old) and a condylarth-like <a href=\"/animal/placental-mammal\">placental mammal</a> in southeastern Queensland. In the same year, the Argentinian paleontologist Rosendo Pascual announced evidence of a 63-million-year old <a href=\"/animal/monotreme\">monotreme</a> from Patagonia in southern <a href=\"/place/Argentina\">Argentina</a>. Pascual and Archer reported it to be strikingly similar to the Australian platypus (genus <em>Obdurodon</em>) of the Middle Miocene (about 15 million years ago).","Emus and cassowaries, mound builders (megapodes), and parrots are almost certainly of Gondwanan origin, as are the side-necked turtles (family Chelidae). Other examples of animals of Gondwanan origin may be found among reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrate groups. Some, such as earthworms belonging to the nonpheretimoid Megascolescini, occur in Australia and India but not in the other continents derived from Gondwana, implying that those animals occurred in a sector of Gondwana from which both Australia and India were derived.","The most ancient part of the Australian fauna predates even the formation of Gondwana. For example, the Queensland lungfish (<em>Neoceratodus</em>) has its closest relatives among the ancient fossil fauna of <a href=\"/place/Europe\">Europe</a>, <a href=\"/place/North-America\">North America</a>, and Asia. Those elements are thought to have evolved between the <a href=\"/science/Cambrian-Period\">Cambrian</a> and the Devonian periods.

The Wilcannia <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/threshold\">threshold</a> divides the Eyre and Murray basins, and the latter is separated from the Otway Basin and the Southern Ocean by the Padthaway Ridge. The Eyre and Murray basins are entirely terrestrial, but the Carpentaria is partly inundated by the sea.","The Carpentaria plains, occupying the basin of the same name, form a narrow lowland corridor between the Isa Highlands and the Einasleigh uplands (part of the Eastern Uplands). They are drained by the Leichhardt, Flinders, and Gilbert rivers and in the south take the form of broadly rolling plains underlain by heavy gray lime-enriched (pedocalic) soils. In the north, however, there are extensive flat depositional plains, some of them related to swamps from the <a href=\"/science/Pleistocene-Epoch\">Pleistocene Epoch</a> (i.e., about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago), some associated with the present floodplains of the braided river systems. Standing above the plains, for example around Normanton, are considerable plateau and mesa remnants of the Paleogene and Neogene laterite surface.","Similar rolling plains with laterite residuals standing above them occur in the Eyre Basin, particularly around the headwaters of the <a href=\"/place/Diamantina-River\">Diamantina</a>, near Kynuna. But to the south, toward the more arid interior, the plains become flatter and are protected by a veneer of stones—the well-known stony desert with its mantle of gibber (hammada, serir, and desert armour). In many parts of southwestern Queensland, northeastern South Australia, and northwestern New South Wales, there are plateau and related relief remnants similar to those found in other parts of the lowlands, although those are capped and protected not by laterite but by silcrete, another hard rock residue. That region is folded in places, and the subsequent dissection by erosive forces has brought about disintegration of the silcrete, which is about 20 million years old and which formerly extended over vast areas of central Australia. That process provided much stony debris for the gibber plains so characteristic of much of central Australia and particularly of the <a href=\"/place/Lake-Eyre\">Lake Eyre</a> depression.","The <a href=\"/science/drainage-basin\">catchment area</a> of Lake Eyre extends over some 500,000 square miles (1,295,000 square km) of central and northern Australia. It occupies the lowest point of the Australian continent (about 50 feet [15 metres] below sea level), and many large river systems drain into it. The rivers drain the driest part of the continent. But no desert is rainless, and floodwaters entirely cover the bed of Lake Eyre about twice each century, the waters deriving not only from central Australia but also from the higher-rainfall areas drained by the headwaters of the Georgina, Diamantina, Thomson, Barcoo, and similar rivers. It is now clear that, during the late Pleistocene, the precipitation of central Australia was heavier than it is now. The interior drainage basin has received vast quantities of sediment and salt by those rivers, past and present. That has provided ample source material for the Simpson Desert dunes, and many of the normally <a href=\"/science/playa\">dry lake</a> beds, including all the large ones, are encrusted with salt. Most of the largest salinas, or salt pans (Eyre, Frome, Torrens, Gregory, and Blanche), are, at least in part, of structural origin, having been formed by downfaulted blocks. Torrens and Gregory are surfaced mainly by gypsum, but the remainder carry a crust of <a href=\"/science/salt\">sodium chloride</a>, common salt. Around the major salinas there are extensive alluvial plains.","Under the prevailing arid conditions, fine dust is winnowed from the surface sediments and can be carried high into the air in dust storms. Some is carried long distances, even reaching New Zealand from time to time. The sand of the alluvium is molded into dune ridges.","<a href=\"/science/sand-dune\">Sand dunes</a> also occupy large areas of the Murray River basin. They are, by contrast, fixed (or “fossil”) dunes, which developed at some time in the recent past and have since been stabilized by higher precipitation conditions. The eastern part of the basin, near the foothills of the Eastern Uplands, shows evidence of those former higher precipitation amounts in the numerous abandoned river channels of the <a href=\"/place/Riverina\">Riverina</a>. But the western Murray plains are a stony as well as a climatic desert. The plains are underlain by limestones of Miocene age (those about 23 to 5.3 million years old) and, in many areas, by calcrete, a calcareous soil accumulation. Instances of water-dissolved sinkholes and enclosed depressions can be found, and there is a lack of surface drainage characteristic of that type of topography. Only the Murray River, which originates outside the area in a different <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environment\">environment</a>, crosses the basin, flowing in a narrow trench in its lower reaches.","In the east of that region there are extensive alluvial plains associated with major tributaries of the Murray.

The uplands are the eroded remnants of an ancient mountain range recently rejuvenated by block faulting. They occupy the site of the Tasman downwarp belt, the sediments of which were folded and faulted in late Paleozoic times. Granite batholiths were intruded into that region, and during the <a href=\"/science/Cenozoic-Era\">Cenozoic Era</a> (the past 66 million years) <a href=\"/science/lava-volcanic-ejecta\">lavas</a> appeared extensively in areas as far apart as northern Queensland and Tasmania.

Extinct cones and craters survive in southeastern Queensland, in the Monaro district of New South Wales, and in western Victoria.","In considerable measure the <a href=\"/science/continental-landform\">landforms</a> reflect the various geologic events. Uplifted structural blocks, many of them trending north to south, are common in some areas, while straight river courses reflect the control exercised by fault zones.

Massive domes or clusters of boulders are common on the exposed granitic batholiths. The lava plains and plateaus display stony rises, shallow alluvial depressions, and volcanic vents and plugs of various types and ages.","Other features reflect the erosional history of the region. Wide areas of the upland had been reduced to a uniform low relief by the time of the later <a href=\"/science/Mesozoic-Era\">Mesozoic Era</a> (about 100 million years ago) and many remnants of the ancient surface, exhumed by erosive action from beneath a later Cretaceous cover (i.e., up to about 65 million years ago), survive in the landscape, notably in northern Queensland.

The Wilcannia <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/threshold\">threshold</a> divides the Eyre and Murray basins, and the latter is separated from the Otway Basin and the Southern Ocean by the Padthaway Ridge. The Eyre and Murray basins are entirely terrestrial, but the Carpentaria is partly inundated by the sea.","The Carpentaria plains, occupying the basin of the same name, form a narrow lowland corridor between the Isa Highlands and the Einasleigh uplands (part of the Eastern Uplands). They are drained by the Leichhardt, Flinders, and Gilbert rivers and in the south take the form of broadly rolling plains underlain by heavy gray lime-enriched (pedocalic) soils. In the north, however, there are extensive flat depositional plains, some of them related to swamps from the <a href=\"/science/Pleistocene-Epoch\">Pleistocene Epoch</a> (i.e., about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago), some associated with the present floodplains of the braided river systems. Standing above the plains, for example around Normanton, are considerable plateau and mesa remnants of the Paleogene and Neogene laterite surface.","Similar rolling plains with laterite residuals standing above them occur in the Eyre Basin, particularly around the headwaters of the <a href=\"/place/Diamantina-River\">Diamantina</a>, near Kynuna. But to the south, toward the more arid interior, the plains become flatter and are protected by a veneer of stones—the well-known stony desert with its mantle of gibber (hammada, serir, and desert armour). In many parts of southwestern Queensland, northeastern South Australia, and northwestern New South Wales, there are plateau and related relief remnants similar to those found in other parts of the lowlands, although those are capped and protected not by laterite but by silcrete, another hard rock residue. That region is folded in places, and the subsequent dissection by erosive forces has brought about disintegration of the silcrete, which is about 20 million years old and which formerly extended over vast areas of central Australia. That process provided much stony debris for the gibber plains so characteristic of much of central Australia and particularly of the <a href=\"/place/Lake-Eyre\">Lake Eyre</a> depression.","The <a href=\"/science/drainage-basin\">catchment area</a> of Lake Eyre extends over some 500,000 square miles (1,295,000 square km) of central and northern Australia. It occupies the lowest point of the Australian continent (about 50 feet [15 metres] below sea level), and many large river systems drain into it. The rivers drain the driest part of the continent. But no desert is rainless, and floodwaters entirely cover the bed of Lake Eyre about twice each century, the waters deriving not only from central Australia but also from the higher-rainfall areas drained by the headwaters of the Georgina, Diamantina, Thomson, Barcoo, and similar rivers. It is now clear that, during the late Pleistocene, the precipitation of central Australia was heavier than it is now. The interior drainage basin has received vast quantities of sediment and salt by those rivers, past and present. That has provided ample source material for the Simpson Desert dunes, and many of the normally <a href=\"/science/playa\">dry lake</a> beds, including all the large ones, are encrusted with salt. Most of the largest salinas, or salt pans (Eyre, Frome, Torrens, Gregory, and Blanche), are, at least in part, of structural origin, having been formed by downfaulted blocks. Torrens and Gregory are surfaced mainly by gypsum, but the remainder carry a crust of <a href=\"/science/salt\">sodium chloride</a>, common salt. Around the major salinas there are extensive alluvial plains.","Under the prevailing arid conditions, fine dust is winnowed from the surface sediments and can be carried high into the air in dust storms. Some is carried long distances, even reaching New Zealand from time to time. The sand of the alluvium is molded into dune ridges.","<a href=\"/science/sand-dune\">Sand dunes</a> also occupy large areas of the Murray River basin. They are, by contrast, fixed (or “fossil”) dunes, which developed at some time in the recent past and have since been stabilized by higher precipitation conditions. The eastern part of the basin, near the foothills of the Eastern Uplands, shows evidence of those former higher precipitation amounts in the numerous abandoned river channels of the <a href=\"/place/Riverina\">Riverina</a>. But the western Murray plains are a stony as well as a climatic desert. The plains are underlain by limestones of Miocene age (those about 23 to 5.3 million years old) and, in many areas, by calcrete, a calcareous soil accumulation. Instances of water-dissolved sinkholes and enclosed depressions can be found, and there is a lack of surface drainage characteristic of that type of topography. Only the Murray River, which originates outside the area in a different <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environment\">environment</a>, crosses the basin, flowing in a narrow trench in its lower reaches.","In the east of that region there are extensive alluvial plains associated with major tributaries of the Murray.

The uplands are the eroded remnants of an ancient mountain range recently rejuvenated by block faulting. They occupy the site of the Tasman downwarp belt, the sediments of which were folded and faulted in late Paleozoic times. Granite batholiths were intruded into that region, and during the <a href=\"/science/Cenozoic-Era\">Cenozoic Era</a> (the past 66 million years) <a href=\"/science/lava-volcanic-ejecta\">lavas</a> appeared extensively in areas as far apart as northern Queensland and Tasmania.

Little more than one-tenth of the continent receives more than 40 inches (1,000 mm) per year. As has been noted, in winter the snowfields of Tasmania and the Mount Kosciuszko area can be extensive, but on the whole Australia is an extremely hot country, in consequence of which evaporation losses are high and the effectiveness of the rainfall received is reduced. In addition, the severity of climate, the predominance of the outdoors in the minds and lives of many, and the national importance of agricultural and pastoral pursuits all make Australians perhaps more climate-conscious than most. In no country of comparable development do climate and weather loom so large in the lives and conversation of the people.","The principal features of Australia’s climate stem from its position, shape, and size. Australia is mainly a compact tropical and near-tropical continent. No major arms or embayments of the sea penetrate far into the landmass. The only extensive uplands occur near the east coast, and even they are not, by world standards, very high.","In summer (December–February), when the sun is directly overhead in northern Australia, temperatures are extremely high. The sea exerts little moderating influence, and the uplands are not sufficiently extensive or high to have more than local effects. Temperatures commonly soar above the 100 °F (38 °C) mark in the interior, but because there rarely is any cloud cover, radiation loss is considerable at night, and daily temperature ranges are wide. High temperatures dominate the Australian summers in all but Tasmania. Heat waves are common, and, though the highest amounts of <a href=\"/science/solar-radiation\">solar radiation</a> are received in northern South Australia, the highest temperatures and longest heat waves are recorded in the northwest of Western Australia. For example, <a href=\"/place/Marble-Bar\">Marble Bar</a> has recorded a maximum temperature of 100 °F or more on 162 consecutive days. Temperatures in winter remain moderate except in the uplands of Tasmania and southeastern Australia, where snow is common. Night frosts are common in winter throughout southern Australia and in the interior.","Because of its relatively low latitudinal position, Australia comes under the influence of the southeast trade winds in the north and the westerlies in the south. Northern Australia is affected by a northerly <a href=\"/science/monsoon\">monsoon</a>, partly because of the <a href=\"/science/latitude\">latitude</a> and the seasonal migration of planetary wind zones and partly because of the summer heating of the continental interior that draws in surface winds.

The trades, forced to rise by the uplands, bring heavy rains to the Pacific coasts of Queensland and northern New South Wales. Those areas are also affected by tropical cyclones and receive the heaviest rains of any part of Australia. Within the coastal fringe, the northern Queensland area around Tully, south of <a href=\"/place/Cairns\">Cairns</a>, is the wettest, with an annual average of nearly 160 inches (4,050 mm).","Southern Australia receives winter rains from depressions associated with the west-wind zone.

The Eremian Zone covers the whole of central Australia through to the west-central coast; its climate is arid.","The major structural units <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constituting\">constituting</a> the geographic distribution are rainforest, sclerophyll forest (dominated by hard-leaved plants such as eucalypts), and woodland, scrub, savanna, and grassland forms, each with a range of subforms. The bulk of the Tropical Zone <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/comprises\">comprises</a> mixed deciduous woodland and sclerophyllous low-tree savanna, with areas of tussock grassland, coastal mangrove complexes, and <a href=\"/science/tropical-rainforest\">tropical rainforest</a> containing much exotic vegetation—particularly in the northeastern parts of Cape York Peninsula and in Queensland. A strong Malesian influence occurs throughout the entire zone. The rainforests—characterized by large trees with stem buttresses and by multiple vegetation layers with interlaced canopies of <a href=\"/plant/liana\">lianas</a> and <a href=\"/plant/epiphyte\">epiphytes</a> growing in the trees—fit the popular concept of “jungle.”","The Temperate Zone is characterized by dry and wet sclerophyllous forests, temperate mixed woodlands, savanna woodlands, mallees, and scrubs, with areas of alpine vegetational complexes, temperate rainforest, and sclerophyllous heath. A much higher proportion of the vegetation cover is typically and recognizably “Australian.” Within that zone the southwestern corner of Western Australia is outstanding, both for the high proportion of Australian plants and for the richness of the plant life, while the vegetation of Tasmania is notable for its forests of southern beech and for its botanical links with New Zealand and South America. In marked contrast to the tropical rainforests, the predominant trees throughout most of the Temperate Zone <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/communities\">communities</a> are either <em>Eucalyptus</em> or <em>Acacia</em>. Much of the Temperate Zone vegetation has been cleared for agricultural purposes, leaving only the vegetation communities of infertile or inaccessible localities.","The vegetation of the Eremian Zone ranges from barely vegetated desert and hills through a variety of semiarid shrub savannas, shrub steppes, semiarid tussock grasslands, and sclerophyllous hummock grasslands. Many shrubs have adapted themselves similarly to the arid conditions, so that in their vegetative state many representatives of different families look alike. <em>Acacia</em>, <em>Eremophila</em>, and <em>Casuarina</em> are examples of genera that tend to displace <em>Eucalyptus</em> as the dominant tree or shrub. Much of that vegetation is badly degraded."],"sections":[],"isFilled":true},{"level":3,"id":"ref45008","sidebarHeader":"Animal life","header":"Animal life","paragraphs":["The distribution of climates, topography, and soils that has produced the zones and ecological variation of Australian vegetation has also been reflected in the distribution of animal life. Australia probably has between 200,000 and 300,000 species, about 100,000 of which have been described. There are some 250 species of native mammals, 550 species of land and aquatic birds, 680 species of reptiles, 190 species of frogs, and more than 2,000 species of marine and freshwater fish. The remainder are invertebrates, including insects.","In the varied environments of the Tropical Zone, species confined to the rainforests of the mountainous northeast include the tree <a href=\"/animal/kangaroo\">kangaroos</a> (genus <em>Dendrolagus</em>) and the gorgeous bird-wing butterflies (<em>Ornithoptera</em>). Others favour more open habitats such as savannas and grasslands. Among that group are the agile <a href=\"/animal/wallaby\">wallaby</a> (<em>Macropus agilis</em>) and <em>Amitermes meridionalis</em>, a termite that orients its mounds in a north-south direction by sensing <a href=\"/science/geomagnetic-field\">Earth’s magnetic field</a>.","The animals of the Eremian Zone are characterized by their ability to survive under extremely arid conditions and irregular rainfall. Examples include the <a href=\"/animal/marsupial-mole\">marsupial mole</a> (<em>Notoryctes typhlops</em>), a burrower in sand, and the water-holding frog of the genus <em>Cyclorana</em>. After rainy spells <em>Cyclorana</em> burrows deep in the soil, forming a chamber in which it lies in a cocoonlike sac filled with water formed from a special outer layer of its skin. The budgerigar (<em>Melopsittacus</em>) is adapted to irregular rainfall by being nomadic.","The <a href=\"/science/faunal-region\">fauna</a> of the eucalyptus forests and other habitats of the Temperate Zone contains animals whose life cycles rely on regular winter rainfall. Many are highly adapted to the eucalyptus forests. The <a href=\"/animal/koala\">koala</a> depends on the foliage of just a few species of forest eucalyptus. Lyrebirds and gray kangaroos are forest dwellers. Gray kangaroos also range into semiarid shrublands and heaths. The only Australian alpine animals occur in the high mountains of the Temperate Zone. They include the mountain pygmy possum (genus <em>Burramys</em>) and the alpine grasshopper (<em>Kosciuscola</em>).","Some species occur in all zones. They include the galah (<em>Cacatua roseicapilla</em>; a species of cockatoo) and the Australian magpie (<em>Gymnorhina tibicen</em>).","Extinction of native species is a matter of much concern. Some 20 mammal, 20 bird, and 70 <a href=\"/plant/angiosperm\">flowering plant</a> species are presumed to have become extinct during the period of European settlement. Some 50 terrestrial mammals and more than 1,000 flowering plants are officially listed as both <a href=\"/science/endangered-species\">endangered</a> or vulnerable; that description is also applied to about 30 amphibians, 50 reptiles, and 50 birds. Estimates of the numbers of introduced species include 1,500 to 2,000 flowering plants, 30 freshwater and marine fish, and about 70 land animals and birds. There has also been a great reduction of range of most species inhabiting temperate or semiarid lands, except for those that have benefited from the extension of pastures and watering points. The latter species include the large kangaroos and the Australian magpie.","The high <a href=\"/topic/degree-education\">degree</a> to which many species depend on a relatively narrow range of vegetation types means that animals of some zones have suffered more from human activity than others. Small and medium-size terrestrial mammals and ground-nesting birds of temperate and semiarid grasslands and shrublands have been most affected by clearing for pastures and cereal crops. In addition, they have suffered most from competition with and habitat destruction by introduced animals such as rabbits, sheep, goats, and cattle and from predation by the foxes and feral cats. Few parts of Australia are free from the effects of introduced animal species. In the tropical north the cane toad (<em>Bufo marinus</em>) is believed to be a major predator of small native vertebrates. Even the introduced honeybee, which is widely established in the feral state, is suspected of affecting native nectar-feeding insects, mammals, and birds.","The role of <a href=\"/topic/Australian-Aboriginal\">Aboriginal</a> people in causing the extinction of fauna before European settlement has been much debated. It is clear that at the time of European settlement Aboriginal hunting and burning had major effects on animal numbers, but a balance seems to have been maintained, possibly assisted by a system of social prohibitions that protected important species under certain conditions. But the effect of the initial Aboriginal entry on the continent is not yet clear. At that time, at least 60,000 years ago, the fauna contained many species of large animals (the Australian megafauna) and was considerably different from the fauna present at the time of European settlement. Such megafaunal animals as the rhinoceros-sized <em>Diprotodon</em>, giant wombats, the giant short-faced kangaroos (<em>Sthenurus</em> and <em>Procoptodon</em>), the so-called <a href=\"/animal/marsupial\">marsupial</a> lion <em>Thylacoleo</em>, and giant flightless birds called mihirungs or <em>Genyornis</em> probably became extinct over a period between 27,000 and 12,000 years ago, possibly as late as 6,000 years ago.","It has been argued that Aboriginal overhunting, together with environmental changes caused by associated Aboriginal burning of the country, caused the extinction of those species. Others have suggested that climatic fluctuations at the end of the Pleistocene (some 11,700 years ago) were a more likely cause. Certainly, although there were no extensive ice sheets in Australia, the last glacial maximum (between 22,000 and 18,000 years ago) was a time of highly arid, as well as cold and windy, conditions. Deserts reached their greatest extent at that time, and there is no doubt that under such conditions the fauna (as well as humans) would have been under considerable physiological stress. No clear <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consensus\">consensus</a> has emerged, and, in view of the facts that there is no evidence of a sudden mass extinction and that Aboriginal people seem to have occupied most of Australia for at least 20,000 years before the last megafauna disappeared, it is likely that a combination of all those factors played a part. By about 20,000 years ago, few mammals had survived that weighed more than their human predators.","Commercial hunting of only a few species of native fauna is allowed. It is confined to several species of the kangaroo family, muttonbirds (<em>Puffinus tenuirostris</em>), and some of the most common cockatoos and parrots; however, federal law does not permit live birds to be exported. Permits can be obtained to destroy pest species (such as kangaroos in certain circumstances). Sport shooting of game birds (ducks, quail, and snipes) and a few mammals is permitted in some states. Before controls were established, the numbers of several attractive varieties of parrots and cockatoos—as well as of crocodiles and such mammals as koalas, brushtail possums, ringtail possums, many wallaby species, and seals—reduced dramatically. Most have recovered, however. Quotas are set for the commercial taking of kangaroos each year for hides and for human and pet food. Numbers of kangaroos are constantly monitored, and there is no evidence of any reduction in the wild populations. Hundreds of thousands of muttonbirds are taken yearly for human consumption.","Fauna authorities and scientists responsible for conserving kangaroos support such commercial exploitation on scientific grounds. Many also believe that it would be in the interest of both conservation and agricultural practice to encourage husbandry of kangaroos. However, many others, both in Australia and elsewhere, are vehemently opposed to killing kangaroos for any reason. The issue has become highly political.","Australia has its share of potentially dangerous, as well as commercially useful, animals. The large saltwater crocodile (<em>Crocodilus porosus</em>) is known to eat humans. Of the many poisonous elapid snakes, the most dangerous to humans include taipans (<em>Oxyuranus</em>), smooth snakes (<em>Parademansia</em>), tiger snakes (<em>Notechis</em>), brown snakes (<em>Pseudonaja</em>), and death adders (<em>Acanthophis</em>); the latter, although smaller than the others, have large fangs, a lightning-fast strike, and highly toxic venom. About one-seventh of Australia’s snake species pose a deadly threat to humans. There are many poisonous spiders, the best-known being the <a href=\"/animal/funnel-web-spider\">funnel-web spider</a> (<em>Atrax</em>) and the red-back (<em>Latrodectus</em>). Both of those have caused human deaths, but only a minute proportion of Australia’s spiders are dangerous. Antivenins are available for the venoms of both spiders and snakes.","Ticks and internal parasitic worms are mainly harmful to stock and domestic pets, and some blood-sucking insects are disease carriers. The larvae of the sheep blowfly <em>Lucilia</em> attack sheep and cause losses worth millions of dollars to the wool industry. Locusts, weevils, and insect larvae of various sorts do great damage in agriculture.","The Australian fauna (and that of New Guinea, which is part of the Australian lithospheric plate) is markedly different from that of the other adjacent land areas (Indonesia and other nearby islands). It is now known that the difference stems from Australia’s long isolation and northward drift into its present geographic position. Thus, the Australian fauna has been derived to a large degree from the lands with which Australia was in contact when it was part of Gondwana. That part of the fauna derived from Asia, which includes the only <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/extant\">extant</a> native placental mammals (rats, mice, bats, and the dingo—the latter probably introduced by Aboriginal people), entered Australia by island-hopping or accidental drifting. As might be expected, flying animals of Asian origin (e.g., bats and birds) reached Australia before the others, and they may have done so soon after Australia separated from Antarctica. Horseshoe bats (family Hipposideridae), which are related to typical Old World forms, appear in the Australian fossil record about 20 million years before the present.","The Gondwanan component gives the Australian fauna its distinctive character. As is the case in South America, Australia has many species of marsupials, but they radiated more widely in Australia than in South America, coming to occupy virtually all mammalian adaptive <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/niches\">niches</a>. Thus, there are marsupial equivalents of moles, anteaters, wolves, flying possums, and antelopes. The only egg-laying <a href=\"/animal/mammal\">mammals</a> in the world—the <a href=\"/animal/platypus\">platypus</a> (genus <em>Ornithorhynchus</em>) and the <a href=\"/animal/echidna-monotreme\">echidna</a> (<em>Tachyglossus</em>); also the <a href=\"/place/New-Guinea\">New Guinea</a> long-beaked echidna (<em>Zaglossus</em>)—are Gondwanan as well, but the oldest related fossil is from the Early <a href=\"/science/Cretaceous-Period\">Cretaceous</a> of central Australia and predates the separation of India from Australia. Until recently it was assumed that placental mammals had not occurred in Australia until they emigrated southward from Asia. Nor was there evidence of distinctively Australian mammal fossils in South America. In 1991, however, the Australian paleontologists Michael Archer, Henk Godthelp, and Suzanne Hand reported finding bats of early Eocene origin (about 55 million years old) and a condylarth-like <a href=\"/animal/placental-mammal\">placental mammal</a> in southeastern Queensland. In the same year, the Argentinian paleontologist Rosendo Pascual announced evidence of a 63-million-year old <a href=\"/animal/monotreme\">monotreme</a> from Patagonia in southern <a href=\"/place/Argentina\">Argentina</a>. Pascual and Archer reported it to be strikingly similar to the Australian platypus (genus <em>Obdurodon</em>) of the Middle Miocene (about 15 million years ago).","Emus and cassowaries, mound builders (megapodes), and parrots are almost certainly of Gondwanan origin, as are the side-necked turtles (family Chelidae). Other examples of animals of Gondwanan origin may be found among reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrate groups. Some, such as earthworms belonging to the nonpheretimoid Megascolescini, occur in Australia and India but not in the other continents derived from Gondwana, implying that those animals occurred in a sector of Gondwana from which both Australia and India were derived.","The most ancient part of the Australian fauna predates even the formation of Gondwana. For example, the Queensland lungfish (<em>Neoceratodus</em>) has its closest relatives among the ancient fossil fauna of <a href=\"/place/Europe\">Europe</a>, <a href=\"/place/North-America\">North America</a>, and Asia. Those elements are thought to have evolved between the <a href=\"/science/Cambrian-Period\">Cambrian</a> and the Devonian periods. Queensland <a href=\"/animal/lungfish\">lungfish</a> are less closely related to the lungfish of Africa and South America (Lepidosirenidae) than to the extinct forms from <a href=\"/place/Asia\">Asia</a>, Europe, and North America.

Fire, more particularly its frequency, had a profound influence on much of Australia’s native vegetation, the surviving remnants of which have become difficult to manage; some changed in composition because the fire frequency decreased, others because the frequency increased. The Australian botanist Helene Martin presented palynological evidence (from the study of pollen and spores) showing how the trends of change in certain types of arid and coastal vegetation, over several thousand years of prehistory, were apparently deflected by the fires of Aboriginal people.","Since Europeans arrived on the continent, cataclysmic changes have been wrought in its biota.

Settlers stripped the native vegetation from most potentially arable and some nonarable regions, substituting mainly exotic (nonnative) herbaceous crops and pastures. In the process, they effected the extinction of many native species and, through sheer decimation and reduction of habitat, pushed many more to the brink of extinction. The vast central and northern regions too arid for the cultivation of crops were stocked with millions of sheep and cattle, converting them to rangelands. Many exotic animals (such as camels) and plants were introduced incidentally, some running wild as pests, without effective control measures.

The result has been an increasingly <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acrimonious\">acrimonious</a> debate. The government established many reserves in all states and territories to protect some native biota and landscapes.

The principal aim of the strategy was to ensure that the frogs survived in the wild by collecting eggs from their natural habitat and by increasing the number of eggs laid in captivity.","The federal and state governments partnered with organizations and landowners to help protect biodiversity “hotspots.” By 2017 the government had identified 15 of these large regions with a high <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diversity\">diversity</a> of native species that are not found, or are only rarely found, anywhere else in the world. One of the most significant of these hotspots, the Tasmanian Midlands, is home to more than 180 rare and threatened plant and animal species, including the <a href=\"/animal/Tasmanian-devil\">Tasmanian devil</a>, the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle (<em>Aquila audax fleayi</em>), and the Eastern (or Tasmanian) bettong (Tasmanian <a href=\"/animal/rat-kangaroo\">rat kangaroo</a> [<em>Bettongia gaimardi</em>]).

The number of general popular books dealing with the ornamental, horticultural, medicinal, culinary, and other uses of plants increased sharply following the publication of a major new flora, the multivolume series <em>Flora of Australia</em> (1981– ).","Australia’s phanerogamian (seed plant) <a href=\"/topic/Flora-Roman-mythology\">flora</a> of approximately 20,000 species is thought to have arisen in ancient times from two distinct intakes of stock. Both stocks had previously been involved in a wider theatre, and each intake was followed by a period when the species adapted and diversified within the continent.

Initial attempts to apply European and American classification concepts to Australia were not particularly satisfactory, because of the peculiarities of the continent’s vegetation and environment. For example, climatic control of local vegetation zones was often found insufficient to explain vegetation changes; on the contrary, soil patterns and geologic history quite override climatic control in many localities.

Australia probably has between 200,000 and 300,000 species, about 100,000 of which have been described. There are some 250 species of native mammals, 550 species of land and aquatic birds, 680 species of reptiles, 190 species of frogs, and more than 2,000 species of marine and freshwater fish. The remainder are invertebrates, including insects.","In the varied environments of the Tropical Zone, species confined to the rainforests of the mountainous northeast include the tree <a href=\"/animal/kangaroo\">kangaroos</a> (genus <em>Dendrolagus</em>) and the gorgeous bird-wing butterflies (<em>Ornithoptera</em>). Others favour more open habitats such as savannas and grasslands. Among that group are the agile <a href=\"/animal/wallaby\">wallaby</a> (<em>Macropus agilis</em>) and <em>Amitermes meridionalis</em>, a termite that orients its mounds in a north-south direction by sensing <a href=\"/science/geomagnetic-field\">Earth’s magnetic field</a>.","The animals of the Eremian Zone are characterized by their ability to survive under extremely arid conditions and irregular rainfall. Examples include the <a href=\"/animal/marsupial-mole\">marsupial mole</a> (<em>Notoryctes typhlops</em>), a burrower in sand, and the water-holding frog of the genus <em>Cyclorana</em>. After rainy spells <em>Cyclorana</em> burrows deep in the soil, forming a chamber in which it lies in a cocoonlike sac filled with water formed from a special outer layer of its skin. The budgerigar (<em>Melopsittacus</em>) is adapted to irregular rainfall by being nomadic.","The <a href=\"/science/faunal-region\">fauna</a> of the eucalyptus forests and other habitats of the Temperate Zone contains animals whose life cycles rely on regular winter rainfall. Many are highly adapted to the eucalyptus forests. The <a href=\"/animal/koala\">koala</a> depends on the foliage of just a few species of forest eucalyptus. Lyrebirds and gray kangaroos are forest dwellers. Gray kangaroos also range into semiarid shrublands and heaths. The only Australian alpine animals occur in the high mountains of the Temperate Zone. They include the mountain pygmy possum (genus <em>Burramys</em>) and the alpine grasshopper (<em>Kosciuscola</em>).","Some species occur in all zones. They include the galah (<em>Cacatua roseicapilla</em>; a species of cockatoo) and the Australian magpie (<em>Gymnorhina tibicen</em>).","Extinction of native species is a matter of much concern. Some 20 mammal, 20 bird, and 70 <a href=\"/plant/angiosperm\">flowering plant</a> species are presumed to have become extinct during the period of European settlement. Some 50 terrestrial mammals and more than 1,000 flowering plants are officially listed as both <a href=\"/science/endangered-species\">endangered</a> or vulnerable; that description is also applied to about 30 amphibians, 50 reptiles, and 50 birds. Estimates of the numbers of introduced species include 1,500 to 2,000 flowering plants, 30 freshwater and marine fish, and about 70 land animals and birds. There has also been a great reduction of range of most species inhabiting temperate or semiarid lands, except for those that have benefited from the extension of pastures and watering points. The latter species include the large kangaroos and the Australian magpie.","The high <a href=\"/topic/degree-education\">degree</a> to which many species depend on a relatively narrow range of vegetation types means that animals of some zones have suffered more from human activity than others. Small and medium-size terrestrial mammals and ground-nesting birds of temperate and semiarid grasslands and shrublands have been most affected by clearing for pastures and cereal crops. In addition, they have suffered most from competition with and habitat destruction by introduced animals such as rabbits, sheep, goats, and cattle and from predation by the foxes and feral cats. Few parts of Australia are free from the effects of introduced animal species. In the tropical north the cane toad (<em>Bufo marinus</em>) is believed to be a major predator of small native vertebrates. Even the introduced honeybee, which is widely established in the feral state, is suspected of affecting native nectar-feeding insects, mammals, and birds.","The role of <a href=\"/topic/Australian-Aboriginal\">Aboriginal</a> people in causing the extinction of fauna before European settlement has been much debated. It is clear that at the time of European settlement Aboriginal hunting and burning had major effects on animal numbers, but a balance seems to have been maintained, possibly assisted by a system of social prohibitions that protected important species under certain conditions. But the effect of the initial Aboriginal entry on the continent is not yet clear. At that time, at least 60,000 years ago, the fauna contained many species of large animals (the Australian megafauna) and was considerably different from the fauna present at the time of European settlement. Such megafaunal animals as the rhinoceros-sized <em>Diprotodon</em>, giant wombats, the giant short-faced kangaroos (<em>Sthenurus</em> and <em>Procoptodon</em>), the so-called <a href=\"/animal/marsupial\">marsupial</a> lion <em>Thylacoleo</em>, and giant flightless birds called mihirungs or <em>Genyornis</em> probably became extinct over a period between 27,000 and 12,000 years ago, possibly as late as 6,000 years ago.","It has been argued that Aboriginal overhunting, together with environmental changes caused by associated Aboriginal burning of the country, caused the extinction of those species. Others have suggested that climatic fluctuations at the end of the Pleistocene (some 11,700 years ago) were a more likely cause. Certainly, although there were no extensive ice sheets in Australia, the last glacial maximum (between 22,000 and 18,000 years ago) was a time of highly arid, as well as cold and windy, conditions. Deserts reached their greatest extent at that time, and there is no doubt that under such conditions the fauna (as well as humans) would have been under considerable physiological stress. No clear <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consensus\">consensus</a> has emerged, and, in view of the facts that there is no evidence of a sudden mass extinction and that Aboriginal people seem to have occupied most of Australia for at least 20,000 years before the last megafauna disappeared, it is likely that a combination of all those factors played a part. By about 20,000 years ago, few mammals had survived that weighed more than their human predators.","Commercial hunting of only a few species of native fauna is allowed. It is confined to several species of the kangaroo family, muttonbirds (<em>Puffinus tenuirostris</em>), and some of the most common cockatoos and parrots; however, federal law does not permit live birds to be exported. Permits can be obtained to destroy pest species (such as kangaroos in certain circumstances). Sport shooting of game birds (ducks, quail, and snipes) and a few mammals is permitted in some states. Before controls were established, the numbers of several attractive varieties of parrots and cockatoos—as well as of crocodiles and such mammals as koalas, brushtail possums, ringtail possums, many wallaby species, and seals—reduced dramatically. Most have recovered, however. Quotas are set for the commercial taking of kangaroos each year for hides and for human and pet food. Numbers of kangaroos are constantly monitored, and there is no evidence of any reduction in the wild populations. Hundreds of thousands of muttonbirds are taken yearly for human consumption.","Fauna authorities and scientists responsible for conserving kangaroos support such commercial exploitation on scientific grounds. Many also believe that it would be in the interest of both conservation and agricultural practice to encourage husbandry of kangaroos. However, many others, both in Australia and elsewhere, are vehemently opposed to killing kangaroos for any reason. The issue has become highly political.","Australia has its share of potentially dangerous, as well as commercially useful, animals. The large saltwater crocodile (<em>Crocodilus porosus</em>) is known to eat humans. Of the many poisonous elapid snakes, the most dangerous to humans include taipans (<em>Oxyuranus</em>), smooth snakes (<em>Parademansia</em>), tiger snakes (<em>Notechis</em>), brown snakes (<em>Pseudonaja</em>), and death adders (<em>Acanthophis</em>); the latter, although smaller than the others, have large fangs, a lightning-fast strike, and highly toxic venom. About one-seventh of Australia’s snake species pose a deadly threat to humans. There are many poisonous spiders, the best-known being the <a href=\"/animal/funnel-web-spider\">funnel-web spider</a> (<em>Atrax</em>) and the red-back (<em>Latrodectus</em>). Both of those have caused human deaths, but only a minute proportion of Australia’s spiders are dangerous. Antivenins are available for the venoms of both spiders and snakes.","Ticks and internal parasitic worms are mainly harmful to stock and domestic pets, and some blood-sucking insects are disease carriers. The larvae of the sheep blowfly <em>Lucilia</em> attack sheep and cause losses worth millions of dollars to the wool industry. Locusts, weevils, and insect larvae of various sorts do great damage in agriculture.","The Australian fauna (and that of New Guinea, which is part of the Australian lithospheric plate) is markedly different from that of the other adjacent land areas (Indonesia and other nearby islands). It is now known that the difference stems from Australia’s long isolation and northward drift into its present geographic position. Thus, the Australian fauna has been derived to a large degree from the lands with which Australia was in contact when it was part of Gondwana. That part of the fauna derived from Asia, which includes the only <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/extant\">extant</a> native placental mammals (rats, mice, bats, and the dingo—the latter probably introduced by Aboriginal people), entered Australia by island-hopping or accidental drifting. As might be expected, flying animals of Asian origin (e.g., bats and birds) reached Australia before the others, and they may have done so soon after Australia separated from Antarctica. Horseshoe bats (family Hipposideridae), which are related to typical Old World forms, appear in the Australian fossil record about 20 million years before the present.","The Gondwanan component gives the Australian fauna its distinctive character. As is the case in South America, Australia has many species of marsupials, but they radiated more widely in Australia than in South America, coming to occupy virtually all mammalian adaptive <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/niches\">niches</a>. Thus, there are marsupial equivalents of moles, anteaters, wolves, flying possums, and antelopes. The only egg-laying <a href=\"/animal/mammal\">mammals</a> in the world—the <a href=\"/animal/platypus\">platypus</a> (genus <em>Ornithorhynchus</em>) and the <a href=\"/animal/echidna-monotreme\">echidna</a> (<em>Tachyglossus</em>); also the <a href=\"/place/New-Guinea\">New Guinea</a> long-beaked echidna (<em>Zaglossus</em>)—are Gondwanan as well, but the oldest related fossil is from the Early <a href=\"/science/Cretaceous-Period\">Cretaceous</a> of central Australia and predates the separation of India from Australia. Until recently it was assumed that placental mammals had not occurred in Australia until they emigrated southward from Asia. Nor was there evidence of distinctively Australian mammal fossils in South America. In 1991, however, the Australian paleontologists Michael Archer, Henk Godthelp, and Suzanne Hand reported finding bats of early Eocene origin (about 55 million years old) and a condylarth-like <a href=\"/animal/placental-mammal\">placental mammal</a> in southeastern Queensland. In the same year, the Argentinian paleontologist Rosendo Pascual announced evidence of a 63-million-year old <a href=\"/animal/monotreme\">monotreme</a> from Patagonia in southern <a href=\"/place/Argentina\">Argentina</a>. Pascual and Archer reported it to be strikingly similar to the Australian platypus (genus <em>Obdurodon</em>) of the Middle Miocene (about 15 million years ago).","Emus and cassowaries, mound builders (megapodes), and parrots are almost certainly of Gondwanan origin, as are the side-necked turtles (family Chelidae). Other examples of animals of Gondwanan origin may be found among reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrate groups. Some, such as earthworms belonging to the nonpheretimoid Megascolescini, occur in Australia and India but not in the other continents derived from Gondwana, implying that those animals occurred in a sector of Gondwana from which both Australia and India were derived.","The most ancient part of the Australian fauna predates even the formation of Gondwana. For example, the Queensland lungfish (<em>Neoceratodus</em>) has its closest relatives among the ancient fossil fauna of <a href=\"/place/Europe\">Europe</a>, <a href=\"/place/North-America\">North America</a>, and Asia. Those elements are thought to have evolved between the <a href=\"/science/Cambrian-Period\">Cambrian</a> and the Devonian periods.

As a reaction, when Australia became a federation in 1901, one of the first laws passed by the newly formed government was the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901. This legislation, known as the “White Australia” policy, was specifically designed to end Asian migration to the country in order to maintain a “white” population. It severely limited the size of Chinese communities in Australia for more than 50 years, until its abolishment in 1973.

The work completed by migrants in different sectors was a valuable contributor to Australia’s rapid <a href=\"/topic/economic-growth\">economic growth</a>. Many industries peaked during this period, particularly the building and manufacturing industries, which came to rely on migrant workers, with one-third of the manufacturing workforce born overseas."],"sections":[],"isFilled":true},{"level":3,"id":"ref338090","sidebarHeader":"The advent of multicultural society","header":"The advent of multicultural society","paragraphs":["The massive influx of migrants in the postwar years marked a major cultural shift from a previously monocultural British-oriented society to one of the world’s most multicultural societies. From 1945 to 1960 Australia’s population almost doubled, from 7 million to 13 million, averaging an annual growth rate of 2.7 percent per year. By 1961, 8 percent of the population was not of British origin, with the largest migrant groups being Italians followed by Germans, Greeks, and Poles.","In the mid-1950s, as the Australian government began to relax its White Australia policy, one of the first changes was to allow non-European migrants the opportunity to apply for citizenship. This was followed by the abolition of the dictation test under the Migration Act of 1958, which put an end to the exclusion of non-European migrants. The most significant change to take place was Prime Minister Harold Holt’s introduction of the Migration Act 1966, which allowed non-Europeans with professional and academic qualifications to apply for entry. This effectively ended the White Australia policy (which was officially abandoned in 1973) with migrants now being selected according to their skills and ability to contribute to Australian society, not on the basis of <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethnicity\">ethnicity</a>. This act also aimed at developing trade, tourism, and closer ties between Australia and other countries, particularly in Asia.","The 1970s marked a significant turning point in official immigration policies and in prior assimilation policies whereby new arrivals were expected to adopt Australian customs and culture. In 1973 the new Labor government, led by Prime Minister <a href=\"/biography/Gough-Whitlam\">Gough Whitlam</a>, <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/implemented\">implemented</a> the Universal Migration Policy, heralding the beginning of a culturally <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diverse\">diverse</a> society. This radical change in policy allowed a person from any country to apply to migrate to Australia, without being discriminated against on the basis of ethnicity, gender, or religion. The policy focused on encouraging skilled and professional workers to apply for immigration to increase Australia’s productive capacity and directly benefit the economy. Mass migration programs were renounced, resulting in a dramatic decline in the number of British and European immigrants from 1975. However, a new wave of migration began with the arrival of the first Asian refugees as part of the assistance programs signed with the <a href=\"/topic/United-Nations\">United Nations</a> to provide resettlement in Australia for people fleeing hardship and government persecution in other countries. As the <a href=\"/event/Vietnam-War\">Vietnam War</a> wound down, most of the refugees came from <a href=\"/place/Southeast-Asia\">Southeast Asia</a>, fleeing persecution by the communist regimes that had taken control in the region. In 1975 the first refugees arrived from Vietnam by boat, landing on the shores of <a href=\"/place/Darwin-Northern-Territory\">Darwin</a>, Northern Territory. By 1985 more than 75,000 refugees from Southeast Asia had come to Australia. These immigrants worked mostly in low-skilled jobs, such as manufacturing. The number of migrants from Asian regions continued to increase during the 1990s, peaking in 1990–91 with 60,900 settlers. By 1998, 33 percent of all migrants arriving in Australia were Asian-born.","The big cities received the bulk of the postwar immigration. <a href=\"/place/Melbourne-Queensland\">Melbourne</a>’s early lead in industrialization was closely associated with the immigration boom, but <a href=\"/place/Sydney-New-South-Wales\">Sydney</a> eventually proved more attractive. The impact of immigration was not confined to these two centres; whereas the overseas-born population accounted for about one-third of the total for Sydney and Melbourne at the start of the 21st century the national proportion was more than one-fifth and rising. Each of the other state capitals and the industrializing provincial centres also received their share of the influx. The impact was much smaller in the rural districts, except for the areas under irrigation.","In addition, most major world crises have introduced fresh waves of immigrants: South and Central Americans fleeing civil wars or government persecution; Hungarian refugees escaping the consequences of the <a href=\"/event/Hungarian-Revolution-1956\">Hungarian Revolution</a> in 1956; and Czechoslovaks departing in the wake of their country’s occupation by the Soviets in 1968. A large Polish migration occurred in 1981 under the Special Humanitarian Program in response to the declaration of <a href=\"/topic/martial-law\">martial law</a> in Poland at the time. Other refugees arrived from the <a href=\"/place/Middle-East\">Middle East</a>, Afghanistan, and China from the 1970s and from the Balkans in the 1990s. Since the end of World War II, some 600,000 refugees and displaced persons have arrived in Australia—more than one-tenth of the total number of new settlers. Consequently, about half of the population has been born overseas or has at least one foreign-born parent.","Thereafter, the share of non-European immigrants, particularly from Asia, began to increase. Most of the debates on immigration have focused on cultural and economic issues and only peripherally on ethnicity, and (with the exception of the complex Aboriginal issues) Australians largely have been spared the kinds of interracial conflict that have scarred other immigrant societies. Nevertheless, opposition to immigration and multiculturalism policies sparked the formation of the anti-immigrant <a href=\"/topic/Pauline-Hansons-One-Nation\">One Nation Party</a> in the late 1990s. Although the party’s success was limited, its position <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/resonated\">resonated</a> with some Australian voters.","Postwar immigration proved an economic boost and achieved its intended purpose of significantly increasing the population size of Australia. In 2011 the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated the resident population to be more than 22 million people, about one-fourth of them having been born overseas. Although many new migrants suffered alienation and <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/discrimination\">discrimination</a>, on the whole this was one of the most successful and positive chapters in the history of Australia and marked the beginning of a new way of living. Australians began to appreciate the benefits of a multicultural society and the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diversity\">diversity</a> offered by migrants from some 200 different countries.","As discussed above, there was a dramatic increase in the Indigenous population after World War II. This growth is usually attributed to greater pride in Aboriginality, the evolution of positive discrimination (affirmative action) policies in education, health, and welfare, and the official adoption of a generous definition of Aboriginal and <a href=\"/topic/Torres-Strait-Islander-people\">Torres Strait Islander peoples</a>. (For a further discussion of the labels, <em>see</em> Britannica usage standards: Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islander peoples of Australia.) The relatively youthful age structure and high <a href=\"/topic/fertility-rate\">fertility rate</a> of those enumerated as Indigenous largely account for the continuing upward trend.

The term <em>bush</em> is applied indiscriminately to most rural or isolated districts regardless of their stage or type of development.","Extensive arid and semiarid areas in Western Australia, Northern Territory, and <a href=\"/place/South-Australia\">South Australia</a> are routinely labeled as actually or virtually uninhabited. This description also applies to remote sections of west-central Queensland and to scattered patches of dry or mountainous wilderness in Victoria, New South Wales, and <a href=\"/place/Tasmania\">Tasmania</a>. On the northern and central mainland some large Aboriginal reserves punctuate the open territory.","In the more useful but still arid and semiarid country, enormous cattle and sheep stations are held under complex leasehold arrangements. Property sizes generally range between 30 and 5,800 square miles (80 and 15,000 square km). Many of the larger holdings are now controlled by Australian banks and investment firms or by large domestic and foreign companies, though original pioneering families are still represented. The fulcrum of the typical big station is a compact base <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/comprising\">comprising</a> the homestead headquarters and separate buildings for the manager, overseer, general and specialized workers, garage and machine shops, butchery, shearing shed, and small airstrip. These pastoral hamlets typically accommodate between 15 and 50 individuals; a few widely scattered huts or cottages might be available for outlying workers. Thus, the private enterprise development of areas much larger than some U.S. states or groups of English counties is essentially in the keeping of small groups of tightly focused communities—albeit under leasehold, not freehold, <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tenures\">tenures</a>.","The gradual improvement in the quantity and reliability of rainfall from this difficult interior to the coast is not uniform, but it is a noticeable tendency and is accompanied by progressively denser settlement. A standard sequence begins with wheat and sheep farming on the drier margins and moves on to more-specialized wheat production and intensive livestock enterprises, <a href=\"/topic/dairying\">dairy farming</a>, and market gardening. Roughly equivalent gradations may be traced in the spacing of properties—for example, from large wheat-sheep enterprises that may exceed 2,500 acres (about 1,000 hectares) held in a mixture of freehold and leasehold tenures down to freehold dairy farms and market gardens using about 100 acres (40 hectares) apiece and often much less than that. Irrigation developments interrupt the sequence in all states.","A combination of government enterprise and the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/initiatives\">initiatives</a> of pioneer families had established the main outlines of this framework by <a href=\"/event/World-War-I\">World War I</a> in the older states and a little later in Queensland and Western Australia. The existence of characteristic Australian farming and grazing belts from state to state can be exaggerated, but, to the extent that these exist, they are the product of common objectives in settlement policy and represent a gradual clarification, by people and governments, of the importance of regional environmental quality.","Prominent mining centres such as <a href=\"/place/Mount-Isa\">Mount Isa</a> in Queensland and <a href=\"/place/Broken-Hill\">Broken Hill</a> in New South Wales are exceptions to the rule that sizable towns cannot be supported in the Outback.

Small service centres are distributed through every region in proportion to the intensity of rural production. Insulated yet also restricted by remoteness, the economies of most of the larger towns incorporate food and fibre processing and assorted light industries. Several towns have been assisted by state and federal decentralization policies aimed largely at reducing the extraordinary concentration in the state and territorial capitals.","Aboriginal land rights campaigners in Northern Territory and in Western Australia and South Australia have achieved significant successes, contributing to the Australianization of the wider national Aboriginal community.

This description was reasonably fair during the first century of European settlement, when wool exports reigned supreme. Wheat, beef, lamb, dairy produce, and a range of irrigated crops also became important, but the key significance of farming and grazing was not challenged.

Chemical deficiencies are particularly common, and it is often necessary to apply generous amounts of phosphate and traces of numerous other nutrients.","With good reason, Australia is regularly described as the driest of the inhabited continents, and vast areas of the country are unsuitable for agricultural production. The average annual rainfall is approximately 18 inches (460 mm), and more than one-third of the mainland, principally the interior, receives less than 10 inches (250 mm). Aridity or semiaridity prevails over most of Australia, and evaporation rates are extremely high, so that less than 2 inches (50 mm) of the national total contributes <a href=\"/science/runoff\">surface runoff</a> for natural and modified systems. The combined discharge from all Australian rivers including the Murray-Darling, the country’s principal river system, is the equivalent of only about half that of <a href=\"/place/China\">China</a>’s <a href=\"/place/Yangtze-River\">Yangtze River</a>, and records for both the <a href=\"/place/Mississippi-River\">Mississippi</a> and the <a href=\"/place/Ganges-River\">Ganges rivers</a> indicate discharges greater than one and one-half times Australia’s <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aggregate\">aggregate</a> total.","In addition, there are wide regional disparities. In the sparsely populated northern sector, runoff draining into the <a href=\"/place/Timor-Sea\">Timor Sea</a> and the <a href=\"/place/Gulf-of-Carpentaria\">Gulf of Carpentaria</a> accounts for half the national total, and the tropical north as a whole contributes about two-thirds. Subsurface resources are extensive. Good groundwater assets have been located in three-fifths of the country, including much of the dry interior. The <a href=\"/place/Great-Artesian-Basin\">Great Artesian Basin</a> is the largest of its type in the world and gives a measure of security to one-fifth of the mainland.","Native <a href=\"/topic/Flora-Roman-mythology\">flora</a> and <a href=\"/topic/Fauna-Roman-goddess\">fauna</a> have been dramatically undervalued. When Europeans began colonizing Australia in 1788, nearly one-tenth of the <a href=\"/science/continent\">continent</a> may have been covered by forest, and two-fifths by woodlands, including savanna woodlands. It seems likely that less than half of the forested area had commercial potential. Yet, until the late 20th century, clearing was done at a frenzied rate and often indiscriminately. In the late 1980s it was roughly estimated that, with the exception of the <a href=\"/place/Northern-Territory\">Northern Territory</a>, the proportions of forest and scrub cover cleared during two centuries of European occupation was between one-third and two-thirds in each state. Even if this is somewhat overstated, it suggests a thoroughly savage onslaught, given the relatively short period of European occupation and the European population’s originally restricted distribution.","Overgrazing has caused some deterioration of the saltbush, stunted trees, and native grasslands of the interior, but in the tropics the productivity of the original pastures has been increased by introducing improved strains of grasses and heat- and tick-resistant cattle. Far too little has been done to farm the <a href=\"/animal/kangaroo\">kangaroo</a> and <a href=\"/animal/wallaby\">wallaby</a> populations on a commercial basis; this might be preferable, on economic and environmental grounds, to the regular culling operations that mainly serve the pet-food trade.","Accelerated soil erosion, including rampaging gully erosion and disfiguring landslips, was noted by the first generations of European settlers in the southeastern colonies. The threat of soil salinization was reported later, especially in the irrigation districts where it was associated with overwatering and poor drainage.","With more than half of Australian land currently being privately owned by land managers or farmers, environmentalists and government agencies have recognized the importance of <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collaborating\">collaborating</a> with local <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/communities\">communities</a> to work toward more sustainable agricultural practices. The key to successful agricultural production is through the maintenance and protection of rich biodiversity in the local area. To assist and support farmers in managing natural resources, the Australian government has provided funding through incentive schemes to farmers and by investing in environmental groups and programs that deliver sustainable agricultural and environmental outcomes.","Land <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/degradation\">degradation</a> became a major issue from the 1980s, when media coverage became intense and well-directed education programs proliferated. In 1989 Landcare, a movement of grassroots organizations, became an official federal government program, the National Landcare Programme. A “Decade of Landcare Plan” was proclaimed for the 1990s, and a nationally coordinated schedule was drawn up to promote new cultivation methods, extensive tree planting, modest and adventurous engineering solutions, and wholesale changes in production systems.","By the 2010s the Landcare movement involved more than 5,400 groups across Australia, with some 90 percent of farmers actively taking part. Recognizing the important role played by Landcare, the government continued to provide millions of dollars in financial assistance to support farmers in carrying out restoration and conservation projects, such as revegetation of native plants, better control of weeds and pests that threaten ecosystems and habitats, and the practice of rotational grazing (moving livestock between paddocks to avoid overgrazing).","Greening Australia, another leading environmental organization, also played an important role in helping to restore the health and productivity of farmlands by working in partnership with landowners, businesses, communities, and all levels of government to <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/implement\">implement</a> large-scale landscape conservation and resource management projects, such as planting thousands of trees and plants every year, which provide food and shelter for wildlife, rehabilitating degraded and overgrazed land, and protecting thousands of native species. These major projects have transformed huge tracts of land and have helped farming communities to thrive and survive. However, despite the fact that extreme rates of land clearing have been reduced, the Australian <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environment\">environment</a> had already been significantly harmed."],"sections":[{"level":3,"id":"ref228697","sidebarHeader":"Agriculture","header":"Agriculture","paragraphs":["Australia’s total <a href=\"/animal/sheep\">sheep</a> population peaked in 1970, dropping by about one-third at the beginning of the 21st century. Nonetheless, Australia remains the world’s leading producer of <a href=\"/topic/wool\">wool</a>, regularly supplying nearly one-third of the global total—this despite a collapse in world prices that caused production to fall steeply during the 1990s. Concurrently, there was a precipitous drop in sheep farming’s proportion of total agricultural revenues. By contrast, Australia’s grain and combined grain and livestock production held stable at about two-fifths of agricultural turnover. During the early 1950s, agricultural production accounted for between one-sixth and one-fifth of the <a href=\"/topic/gross-domestic-product\">gross domestic product</a> (GDP), but by the beginning of the 21st century that proportion had declined to less than 5 percent. Much of the decline was attributed to reorganized economic priorities; some of it, however, was the result of increasing competition from European and North American producers who took advantage of subsidies and enhancement programs.","The number and importance of small operations has also steadily declined. Roughly half of the country’s farm establishments combined now contribute less than one-fifth of Australia’s total agricultural output, but about one-tenth of the farm businesses account for roughly half of production.","Australia is an important source of export cereals, meat, sugar, dairy produce, and fruit. Landholdings are characteristically large, specialized, owner-operated, capital-intensive, export-oriented, and intricately interlinked through the activities of producers’ associations and government organizations. Less than one-tenth of the country is used for intensive production; one-fourth is virtually unused, and three-fifths is employed for sparse grazing on natural or near-natural pastures. Only a minute fraction is irrigated. <a href=\"/plant/wheat\">Wheat</a> is the country’s leading grain crop and is grown in every state, with production concentrated in the wheat belts of the southeast and southwest. Up to four-fifths of the grain is exported, chiefly to eastern Asia, the <a href=\"/place/Middle-East\">Middle East</a>, and the Pacific region. In contrast to its Northern Hemisphere competitors, Australia does not have the standard winter or spring wheats and does not produce red-grained wheat; rather, all Australian wheats are white-grained, principally intended for breads and noodles, and are planted in the winter months of May, June, and July. The main harvest begins in <a href=\"/place/Queensland-state-Australia\">Queensland</a> in September or October and ends in <a href=\"/place/Victoria-state-Australia\">Victoria</a> and southern <a href=\"/place/Western-Australia\">Western Australia</a> in January; production is highly mechanized. The crop has become closely <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integrated\">integrated</a> with sheep grazing and the cultivation of barley, oats, and other grains and with the production of green fodder and hay for livestock.","Intensive <a href=\"/plant/sugarcane\">sugarcane</a> farming is significant in Queensland’s coastal districts, on the northern coastal plains of <a href=\"/place/New-South-Wales\">New South Wales</a>, and in the Ord Irrigated District in northwestern Western Australia. Production operations are highly sophisticated, from planting and harvesting to milling; the most <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/arduous\">arduous</a> manual labour traditionally associated with this cultivation was replaced long ago by efficient mechanization. Sugar represents Australia’s second-biggest crop export.","Other important crops include cotton (the second most valuable crop, after wheat), rice, tobacco, temperate and tropical fruits, corn (maize), sorghum, oilseeds, and a host of other items reflecting the expansive latitudinal range of farming operations. <a href=\"/topic/wine\">Wine</a> making for domestic and export markets is pursued in every state but is most significant in the southern parts of the country. The sector experienced spectacular growth in the 1990s, with production of wine grapes increasing by three-fifths during the decade to supply some 1,200 wineries. Nearly half of wine exports are directed to the United Kingdom. Other major markets include the United States, <a href=\"/place/New-Zealand\">New Zealand</a>, <a href=\"/place/Canada\">Canada</a>, and <a href=\"/place/Germany\">Germany</a>.","Sheep are raised in most of the agricultural regions and under widely varying environmental conditions, but one-third of the total graze wholly on the natural fodders of the dry “pastoral zone,” much of which is the undisputed domain of the <a href=\"/animal/Merino-breed-of-sheep\">Merino</a>. In belts with higher precipitation levels (15–25 inches [380–635 mm] annually) sheep are farmed in conjunction with wheat and other cereals, and the flocks include breeds other than the Merino. Approximately two-fifths of the national flock is located in these “wheat-and-sheep” belts. Areas with moderately reliable rainfall produce most of Australia’s superfine wool. Mutton and lamb production is particularly important in mixed-farming areas of Victoria, commonly in association with wheat.","Australia’s total <a href=\"/animal/cattle-livestock\">cattle</a> population peaked in the mid-1970s and has subsequently shrunk by about one-fourth. Most of Australia’s beef cattle are raised in Queensland, the Northern Territory, and New South Wales, but the industry is important in all productive regions. The favoured breeds are British in origin, predominantly Herefords and Shorthorns, but in the tropical areas resistance to heat, ticks, and insects is required, and zebu types such as Africander, Brahman, and <a href=\"/animal/Santa-Gertrudis\">Santa Gertrudis</a> are used in crossbreeding programs. Management styles range from high-tech sophistication on numerous southern properties to a more rough-and-ready approach on giant northern cattle stations, where the annual musters (roundups) resemble hunting expeditions and the stockmen’s horses have been replaced by helicopters, motorbikes, and four-wheel-drive vehicles.","Another characteristic of the <a href=\"/place/Outback\">Outback</a> beef industry is that stock is transported long distances to meat-processing centres or pasture. The old dependence on a government-monitored system of wide “stock routes” plied by expert drovers has been replaced by modern trucking, including the distinctive “road trains” (large trucks, each pulling several trailers) of the north, and by reasonably maintained roads capable of supporting these <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/behemoths\">behemoths</a>.","Australia’s governments are intimately involved in most aspects of rural production. Their <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/purview\">purview</a> extends from initiating pioneer settlement to conducting intensive scientific research and providing advisory and educational services.

The transport system was designed to maintain this trade, with roads and railways radiating from the main ports. Little thought was given to internal transport between the colonies. An unfortunate relic of this situation was that three different railway gauges were maintained.

Aridity or semiaridity prevails over most of Australia, and evaporation rates are extremely high, so that less than 2 inches (50 mm) of the national total contributes <a href=\"/science/runoff\">surface runoff</a> for natural and modified systems. The combined discharge from all Australian rivers including the Murray-Darling, the country’s principal river system, is the equivalent of only about half that of <a href=\"/place/China\">China</a>’s <a href=\"/place/Yangtze-River\">Yangtze River</a>, and records for both the <a href=\"/place/Mississippi-River\">Mississippi</a> and the <a href=\"/place/Ganges-River\">Ganges rivers</a> indicate discharges greater than one and one-half times Australia’s <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aggregate\">aggregate</a> total.","In addition, there are wide regional disparities. In the sparsely populated northern sector, runoff draining into the <a href=\"/place/Timor-Sea\">Timor Sea</a> and the <a href=\"/place/Gulf-of-Carpentaria\">Gulf of Carpentaria</a> accounts for half the national total, and the tropical north as a whole contributes about two-thirds. Subsurface resources are extensive. Good groundwater assets have been located in three-fifths of the country, including much of the dry interior. The <a href=\"/place/Great-Artesian-Basin\">Great Artesian Basin</a> is the largest of its type in the world and gives a measure of security to one-fifth of the mainland.","Native <a href=\"/topic/Flora-Roman-mythology\">flora</a> and <a href=\"/topic/Fauna-Roman-goddess\">fauna</a> have been dramatically undervalued. When Europeans began colonizing Australia in 1788, nearly one-tenth of the <a href=\"/science/continent\">continent</a> may have been covered by forest, and two-fifths by woodlands, including savanna woodlands. It seems likely that less than half of the forested area had commercial potential. Yet, until the late 20th century, clearing was done at a frenzied rate and often indiscriminately. In the late 1980s it was roughly estimated that, with the exception of the <a href=\"/place/Northern-Territory\">Northern Territory</a>, the proportions of forest and scrub cover cleared during two centuries of European occupation was between one-third and two-thirds in each state. Even if this is somewhat overstated, it suggests a thoroughly savage onslaught, given the relatively short period of European occupation and the European population’s originally restricted distribution.","Overgrazing has caused some deterioration of the saltbush, stunted trees, and native grasslands of the interior, but in the tropics the productivity of the original pastures has been increased by introducing improved strains of grasses and heat- and tick-resistant cattle. Far too little has been done to farm the <a href=\"/animal/kangaroo\">kangaroo</a> and <a href=\"/animal/wallaby\">wallaby</a> populations on a commercial basis; this might be preferable, on economic and environmental grounds, to the regular culling operations that mainly serve the pet-food trade.","Accelerated soil erosion, including rampaging gully erosion and disfiguring landslips, was noted by the first generations of European settlers in the southeastern colonies. The threat of soil salinization was reported later, especially in the irrigation districts where it was associated with overwatering and poor drainage.","With more than half of Australian land currently being privately owned by land managers or farmers, environmentalists and government agencies have recognized the importance of <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collaborating\">collaborating</a> with local <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/communities\">communities</a> to work toward more sustainable agricultural practices. The key to successful agricultural production is through the maintenance and protection of rich biodiversity in the local area. To assist and support farmers in managing natural resources, the Australian government has provided funding through incentive schemes to farmers and by investing in environmental groups and programs that deliver sustainable agricultural and environmental outcomes.","Land <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/degradation\">degradation</a> became a major issue from the 1980s, when media coverage became intense and well-directed education programs proliferated. In 1989 Landcare, a movement of grassroots organizations, became an official federal government program, the National Landcare Programme. A “Decade of Landcare Plan” was proclaimed for the 1990s, and a nationally coordinated schedule was drawn up to promote new cultivation methods, extensive tree planting, modest and adventurous engineering solutions, and wholesale changes in production systems.","By the 2010s the Landcare movement involved more than 5,400 groups across Australia, with some 90 percent of farmers actively taking part. Recognizing the important role played by Landcare, the government continued to provide millions of dollars in financial assistance to support farmers in carrying out restoration and conservation projects, such as revegetation of native plants, better control of weeds and pests that threaten ecosystems and habitats, and the practice of rotational grazing (moving livestock between paddocks to avoid overgrazing).","Greening Australia, another leading environmental organization, also played an important role in helping to restore the health and productivity of farmlands by working in partnership with landowners, businesses, communities, and all levels of government to <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/implement\">implement</a> large-scale landscape conservation and resource management projects, such as planting thousands of trees and plants every year, which provide food and shelter for wildlife, rehabilitating degraded and overgrazed land, and protecting thousands of native species. These major projects have transformed huge tracts of land and have helped farming communities to thrive and survive. However, despite the fact that extreme rates of land clearing have been reduced, the Australian <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environment\">environment</a> had already been significantly harmed."],"sections":[{"level":3,"id":"ref228697","sidebarHeader":"Agriculture","header":"Agriculture","paragraphs":["Australia’s total <a href=\"/animal/sheep\">sheep</a> population peaked in 1970, dropping by about one-third at the beginning of the 21st century.

Manufacturing became an instrument of development policy, and government assistance was provided in several forms, including by imposing protective tariffs designed to increase employment through import substitution and by the deliberate seeding of selected population centres with government-aided industries. Foreign investment increased steadily after 1950; overseas interests now control about one-third of the manufacturing sector.","Japanese and American corporations are prominent in the motor vehicle industry, which includes assembly and full-production plants. Motor vehicle manufacture is a principal source of employment in each of the mainland state capitals and has become closely associated with immigrant labour.

About two-thirds of the employment in manufacturing is concentrated in New South Wales and Victoria.","Since the 1960s manufacturing has declined steadily. The change is attributable to the independent decisions of multinational corporations to move production offshore to Asian countries with lower wages, to reductions in protective tariffs and other controls on imports, and to increasing domestic labour costs. Early offshore moves bit deeply into a long list of old, established industries with assured domestic markets, including clothing, electrical goods, footwear, household appliances, leather goods, and printing and transport equipment.

The system has been modified several times, though its broad outlines remain intact. In 1956 the court, which was vested with both judicial and arbitral powers (found to be in violation of the constitution), was replaced by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, which in turn was supplanted in 1973 by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

Proponents of this view often refer to the close intertwining of Japanese industrial expansion and the direct influence exerted by Japanese investment in Australia, notably in the mining of coal and iron ore. The argument is complicated, however, by the continuing strength of Australian-U.S. connections and especially by expanding trade ties with several industrializing neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region, most notably China, which by the first decade of the 21st century had become Australia’s biggest trading partner.

Moreover, the main lines of road and rail transport were laid down in the second half of the 19th century, when Australia was a collection of separate colonies, each of which looked to Britain for most of its trade. The transport system was designed to maintain this trade, with roads and railways radiating from the main ports. Little thought was given to internal transport between the colonies. An unfortunate relic of this situation was that three different railway gauges were maintained. It was not until 1970 that it became possible to go by train from Sydney on the east coast to <a href=\"/place/Perth-Western-Australia\">Perth</a> in the west without changing trains. Air, rail, and water transport services were owned by the government until the 1980s, when a process of deregulation and privatization began.","Australia is almost entirely devoid of internal waterways. The <a href=\"/place/Murray-Darling-river-system\">Murray-Darling system</a> supplied important arteries in the 19th century, when it was used to transport wool and other produce from the country districts of New South Wales and Victoria to the coast. Variable volumes in the rivers made such shipping hazardous and unreliable, and it soon <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/succumbed\">succumbed</a> to competition from the railways. In contrast, the great distances, low topography, and predominance of suitable weather conditions have made flying a comparatively safe and economical option.","Modern road networks perpetuate the historical pattern, radiating from the ports and especially from the state capitals. In the 1980s the federal government initiated a bicentennial program that improved many of the main roads, but the heavily used highways between the capitals required further attention to bring them up to the necessary quality. Modern expressways and throughways are becoming standard features in the larger capitals.","Rail transport has played a crucial role in the Australian economy, but most systems have suffered in competition with road and air services. During the late 20th century, there were widespread closures of rural and suburban rail lines. Freight and passenger services alike were progressively reformed and <a href=\"/topic/privatization\">privatized</a> through the 1990s, but a residual measure of government ownership remained. In 1991 the National Rail Corporation was established to take over all interstate traffic.","Port facilities were also privatized in the 1990s. The main ports are located on the east coast, the most important being Sydney (with nearby Botany Bay) for mixed freight.

There are many smaller airports serving other state capitals, <a href=\"/place/Canberra\">Canberra</a>, provincial centres, resorts, and mining developments. Both freight and passenger services have grown steadily.","Australia’s telecommunications sector was highly centralized until the late 20th century. The national government took control of services in 1901, overseen by the Postmaster General’s Department. An Overseas Telecommunications Commission, established in 1946, was given a monopoly in international telecommunications. In 1975 telecommunications functions were vested in Telecom Australia, which was given a monopoly for all domestic services. In the early 1980s satellite services were made the responsibility of AUSSAT, which was publicly owned and which started commercial services in 1985. In 1989 the government began <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/implementing\">implementing</a> reforms, though the monopolies were maintained; by 1991, however, limited competition was introduced. Telestra (formed from Telecom Australia and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission) was partially privatized in 1996, and full competition in the sector ensued beginning in 1997. The industry is overseen by the minister for communications, information technology, and the arts, who wields significant regulatory authority, with the ability to impose conditions on telecommunications providers, and the Australian Communications Authority (ACA), established in 1999, which licenses carriers and reports to the minister for communications. With the opening of competition, by the early 21st century there were some 70 ACA-licensed providers.","Internet use climbed dramatically during the late 1990s in Australia.

After some experimentation with Modernist forms, a heightened interest in regional architecture developed in the period following World War II. In particular, the Sydney school of architects, including Peter Muller, Bruce Rickard, and Richard Norman Johnson, created organic domestic architecture, somewhat reminiscent of the work of American <a href=\"/biography/Frank-Lloyd-Wright\">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>, that was in tune with the needs and natural features of particular sites.

The most significant film of the silent era was <em>The Sentimental Bloke</em> (1919), a tale of a working-class fellow in search of romance that embraced the slang and culture of Sydney. Film production from 1930 to 1950 was limited mostly to documentaries developed under the guidance of the Commonwealth Film Unit.

The British government planned to develop the region’s economy by employing convict labour on government farms, while former convicts would subsist on their own small plots.","The First Fleet sailed on May 13, 1787, with 11 vessels, including 6 transports, aboard which were about 730 convicts (570 men and 160 women). More than 250 free persons accompanied the convicts, chiefly marines of various rank. The fleet reached <a href=\"/place/Botany-Bay\">Botany Bay</a> on January 19–20, 1788. Crisis threatened at once.

Macquarie associated himself with the <a href=\"/topic/Emancipist\">Emancipist</a> faction, a group that argued in favour of former convicts having a particular claim upon government and the colony’s resources.","Macquarie’s attitude disturbed the imperial government. After an official inquiry (1819–21) by John Thomas Bigge, the government encouraged the migration of men of some standing and wealth to both New South Wales and Tasmania. Such men received substantial grants of land and appeared to be the natural leaders of social and economic development. The Emancipists continued to be strong, however, especially through the leadership of <a href=\"/biography/W-C-Wentworth\">William Charles Wentworth</a> (himself the son of a convict woman), whose newspaper, the <em>Australian</em> (founded 1824), was the spearhead of opposition, especially to Governor Ralph Darling (served 1825–31).

In Australia the convicts were either employed by the government or “assigned” to private employers. In general, conditions were not especially harsh or repressive, and “tickets of leave” and pardons provided relatively quick routes to freedom. Assignment to the new settlers of the 1820s, however, often had an element of slavery, and many convicts must have suffered grief and despair in their exile. Most convicts committed some further misdeeds, although only about one-tenth were charged with serious offenses.

The convicts gave Australia a <em>Lumpenproletariat</em>; but success stories were common enough, and many convicts led decent lives. There were only a few large-scale protests; the most remarkable was the <a href=\"/event/Castle-Hill-Rising\">Castle Hill Rising</a> among Irish convicts outside Sydney in March 1804. Altogether, the impact of such a large convict population was less grim and ugly than might be expected.","The maintenance of convicts was essentially the economic resource of the colony for many years; this function entailed very considerable expenditure by the British government. Wealth was won by supplying government stores with food and grain or by controlling internal trade—or both. The officers of the New South Wales Corps were skilled in filling these roles, although civil officers, private settlers, former convicts, and even serving convicts all had their own means of doing business, and the amount of petty commercial activity was large. Farming was pursued on a widely ranging scale. <a href=\"/biography/John-Macarthur\">John Macarthur</a> was the most notable of those who early believed that <a href=\"/topic/wool\">wool</a> growing would be a major economic resource; he himself received a substantial land grant in 1805 to pursue this hope, and he persuaded Bigge of its validity. By 1830 these hopes were still some distance from fulfillment: sheep long returned more value from their meat than from their wool, and the breeding of wooled sheep suitable to the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environment\">environment</a> took time. The 1820s saw that process quickening, with relatively greater strength in Tasmania. <a href=\"/topic/sealing-hunting\">Sealing</a> and <a href=\"/topic/whaling\">whaling</a> also proved profitable, although the richest seal fields (especially in Bass Strait) were soon thinned; and not until the 1820s did colonists have the wealth to engage seriously in whaling, although British and Americans early used Australian ports for this purpose. Maritime adventure led early colonists to make contact with Pacific islands, most importantly Tahiti.","The period saw some notable exploration by land. From early days in Sydney settlers sought a way over the mountains, some 50–100 miles west. The task was accomplished in 1813; the young Wentworth led the party. A surveyor, <a href=\"/biography/George-William-Evans\">George William Evans</a>, followed their route to Bathurst (founded 1815) and reported rich pastoral country. <a href=\"/biography/John-Oxley\">John Oxley</a> further mapped the inland plains and rivers, especially the Lachlan and Macquarie, and also explored the southern coasts of the future Queensland (1823), while <a href=\"/biography/Allan-Cunningham-Scottish-poet\">Allan Cunningham</a> was the great pioneer of that state’s hinterland (1827). Meanwhile, in 1824–25, <a href=\"/biography/Hamilton-Hume\">Hamilton Hume</a> and William Hovell went overland southward to the western shore of Port Phillip. <a href=\"/biography/Charles-Sturt\">Charles Sturt</a> in 1828–30 won still greater fame by tracing the Murray-Murrumbidgee-Darling river system down to the Murray’s mouth.","The writings of explorers and pioneers were Australia’s first contributions to literary culture. While catering to the European appetite for natural history, they sometimes achieved literary grace. Pictorial illustrations of the new land, some by convicts, also dated from the earliest years. <a href=\"/biography/David-Collins\">David Collins’s</a> <em>An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales</em> (1798) and <a href=\"/biography/W-C-Wentworth\">Wentworth’s</a> <em>Description of New South Wales</em> (1817) were literate, informed, and impressive.

He argued that, if land were sold at a “sufficient” price, its owners would be forced to maximize its value by cultivation, while labourers would have to lend their energies to that task before being able to become landowners themselves.

The <a href=\"/event/Australian-Colonies-Government-Act\">Australian Colonies Government Act</a> (1850) extended this situation to Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania. The act made allowance for further revision of the colonial constitutions, and in 1855–56 this took effect in the four colonies, Tasmania then abandoning the name Van Diemen’s Land. Queensland followed after its separation from New South Wales. All had bicameral legislatures, with ministers responsible to the lower houses, which by 1860, except in Tasmania, were elected on a near-democratic basis (all adult non-Aboriginal men were eligible to vote). In Victoria and South Australia the secret ballot was introduced in 1856 (<em>see</em> <a href=\"/topic/Australian-ballot\">Australian ballot</a>).","While the imperial power thus responded to colonial cries for self-rule, on the way there were some tense moments. Virtually all colonists <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/abhorred\">abhorred</a> paying taxes for imperial purposes, including the costs of maintaining convicts locally; a good many disliked convictism altogether; most disputed the imperial right to dictate land policy; and many, especially in South Australia, disapproved of the imperial government’s directing that aid be given to religious denominations.","From the outset of the period, the imperial government fostered a freer market in land and labour throughout the colonies, not merely in South Australia. Thus, grants of land ceased in 1831, replaced by sale. Attempts to create a pastoral-lease system caused much friction, with colonists generally hostile to any demand for payment. In New South Wales in 1844, new regulations even prompted talk of rebellion.","With regard to labour, colonists agreed with imperial encouragement of free migration, but friction arose over the <a href=\"/topic/penal-colony\">convicts</a>. British opinion in the 1830s became increasingly critical of the assignment of convicts to private employers as smacking of slavery; it was abolished in 1840, and with it transportation of convicts to the mainland virtually ceased, although increased numbers were sent to Tasmania. The end of assignment removed the chief virtue of transportation, from the colonists’ viewpoint, and so contributed to a vigorous movement against its continuation. The British government ended transportation to eastern Australia in 1852. In Western Australia transportation began in 1850, at the colonists’ behest, and continued until 1868. Altogether some 151,000 convicts were sent to eastern Australia and nearly 10,000 to Western Australia.","In the early 1850s the most dramatic political problem arose from the <a href=\"/event/gold-rush\">gold rushes</a>.

(In 1918 the name <a href=\"/topic/Australian-Labor-Party\">Australian Labor Party</a> [ALP] was adopted throughout Australia.)

There was considerable administrative innovation—e.g., the Loan Council regulated all <a href=\"/topic/government\">government</a> borrowing—and the successful Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (later called the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation [CSIRO]) was established in 1926 to apply scientific expertise to developmental problems. The worldwide development of consumer industry had its impact: the revolution in <a href=\"/technology/transportation-technology\">transportation</a> provided by the automobile is the best example, although full-scale car production was still in the future.","With much economic activity subsidized—the exception being one primary product, wool—Australia was particularly <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vulnerable\">vulnerable</a> to the <a href=\"/event/Great-Depression\">Great Depression</a> of the 1930s.

The rate of recovery was uneven, manufactures doing better than primary industry. <a href=\"/science/population-biology-and-anthropology\">Population</a> growth slowed; at the nadir, emigration exceeded immigration.","Politics reflected the impact. <a href=\"/biography/James-Henry-Scullin\">James Henry Scullin</a> succeeded Bruce as <a href=\"/topic/prime-minister\">prime minister</a> in October 1929, but his Labor ministry suffered the real squeeze of events; within the ALP there was considerable division as to how government should react to the Depression. Some favoured a generally inflationist policy, with banks <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/facilitating\">facilitating</a> credit issue and governments extending <a href=\"/technology/public-utility\">public works</a>. Right-wing Labor distrusted such a policy; <a href=\"/topic/radical-ideologist\">radicals</a> would have gone further by renouncing interest payment on overseas loans. Conservative opinion argued for deflationary policies—curtailed government expenditure, lower wages, balancing the budget, and the honouring of interest commitments. In June 1931 the <a href=\"/topic/Commonwealth-association-of-states\">Commonwealth</a> and the state governments agreed on a plan, called the Premiers’ Plan. Although the plan had some inflationary features, it foreshadowed a one-fifth reduction in government spending, including <a href=\"/topic/wage\">wages</a> and <a href=\"/topic/pension\">pensions</a>—a considerable affront to Labor’s traditional attitudes.","Against this background the government disintegrated. Before the Premiers’ Plan, some Labor right-wingers, led by <a href=\"/biography/Joseph-Aloysius-Lyons\">Joseph Aloysius Lyons</a>, had crossed to the opposition. In November some leftist dissidents voted against Scullin, forcing his resignation. In the elections that followed, Labor suffered a heavy defeat. The new prime minister was Lyons, whose followers had coalesced with the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/erstwhile\">erstwhile</a> Nationalists to form the <a href=\"/topic/United-Australia-Party\">United Australia Party</a> (UAP). Lyons led a wholly UAP government until 1934 and UAP-Country coalitions until his death in 1939.","The Lyons governments provided stability and not much more. Recovery was uneven and sporadic, quicker in manufacturing than in primary industry, aided more by market forces than by governmental planning. Two policies failed to fulfill expectations—the Imperial Economic Conference, held at Ottawa, Ontario, <a href=\"/place/Canada\">Canada</a>, in 1932, improved trade slightly, but the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integrated\">integrated</a> economic <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community\">community</a> for which some had hoped never developed.

A plan for national <a href=\"/topic/insurance\">insurance</a>, the Lyons governments’ most ambitious social legislation, also aborted. These mishaps did not much bother the electorate; improvement, even if meagre, was enough to retain favour.","Internal division was the greater threat to the government. This became <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manifest\">manifest</a> after Lyons’s death. The UAP elected <a href=\"/biography/Robert-Menzies\">Robert Gordon Menzies</a> its new leader (and therefore prime minister); but the decision was hard fought, and it was criticized publicly and vehemently by Page, still leader of the Country Party. Nevertheless, Menzies retained office; but internal division persisted, the <a href=\"/topic/coalition\">coalition</a>’s parliamentary majority was tiny, and Menzies resigned in August 1941. Arthur William Fadden, the new leader of the Country Party, then took office, but in October he gave way to <a href=\"/biography/John-Curtin\">John Curtin</a> and a Labor ministry.","While the electorate generally voted conservative, Australia shared the common Western experience of the interwar years in the rise of a small, vigorous communist movement. Founded in 1922, the Australian Communist Party made most headway in the big industrial unions and in Sydney; it also had some influence and supporters among the intelligentsia, especially in the 1930s. The party suffered a share of internal factionalism but for the most part was able to present a united face to the public.","<a href=\"/topic/fascism\">Fascism</a> achieved no formal political recognition in Australia, but there were hints of sympathy toward fascist attitudes—<a href=\"/biography/D-H-Lawrence\">D.H.

At the <a href=\"/event/Paris-Peace-Conference\">Paris Peace Conference</a> that formally concluded <a href=\"/event/World-War-I\">World War I</a>, Hughes was his fire-eating self, especially in defense of Australia’s interests in the Pacific.

In the <a href=\"/topic/League-of-Nations\">League of Nations</a>, Australia was an independent member from the outset. Yet in following years “the empire” became the object of even more <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rhetoric\">rhetoric</a> and more desperate hope than earlier.

Although fear of Japan continued, that country’s accession to the fascist camp did not provoke a tougher governmental line.

From early in the war, the Royal Australian Air Force was active in the defense of Britain.

All unmarried men age 21  were required to complete three months of compulsory military training in the Citizen Military Forces (also known as the Militia). Because the Defence Act of 1903 restricted conscription to soldiers fighting on Australian land, a separate volunteer force, the 2nd Australian Imperial Force, was established to send troops to fight abroad while the Citizens Military Force defended the homeland and its territories.","In 1942 the worsening situation in the Pacific and in Southeast Asia, along with the consequent threat of a Japanese land invasion in northern Australia, caused widespread panic in Australia and led the government to take drastic measures to protect the country and its territories. John Curtin, leader of the Australian Labor Party, who had succeeded Menzies as prime minister, reversed his strong personal opposition to compulsory overseas military service to allow the government to conscript soldiers to fight the Japanese in the “South-West Pacific Area.” Enacted on February 19, 1943, the Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Act of 1943 extended the defense of Australia to include the territory of New Guinea and adjacent islands, thus allowing for the conscription of Australian troops to serve in the “South-Western Pacific Zone.”","The <a href=\"/place/United-States\">United States</a> became Australia’s major ally. In a famous statement (December 1941), Prime Minister Curtin declared: “I make it quite clear that Australia looks to America, free from any pangs about our traditional links of friendship to Britain.” A sharper note of independence from Britain came when Curtin insisted (February 1942) that Australian troops recalled from the <a href=\"/place/Middle-East\">Middle East</a> should return to Australia itself and not help in the defense of Burma (<a href=\"/place/Myanmar\">Myanmar</a>) as British Prime Minister <a href=\"/biography/Winston-Churchill\">Winston Churchill</a> wished.

When American troops began arriving in Australia in December 1941, their presence was warmly welcomed. However, Australian attitudes toward them began to change, particularly the attitude of Australian soldiers who felt threatened by the attention Australian women showed toward the better-paid, more stylishly uniformed American soldiers. The increasing tension erupted into the “<a href=\"/event/Battle-of-Brisbane\">Battle of Brisbane</a>,” two nights of large-scale rioting that took place between Australians and U.S. servicemen in Brisbane’s central business district on November 26–27, 1942. One Australian died and hundreds were wounded on both sides as a result of the violent clash.","Brisbane also figured large in an <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alleged\">alleged</a> defense strategy that ultimately proved to be a canard, according to which, in the event of a Japanese invasion, the northern parts of the continent beyond “the Brisbane Line” between Brisbane and Perth were to have been conceded to the enemy without resistance. Supposedly, the objective of this plan was to concentrate Australian armed forces between Brisbane and Melbourne, where most of the crucial industrial regions were located. The idea was that the sheer distance that would have to be traveled by Japanese forces to reach the Brisbane Line would be debilitating for them.","During an election campaign in October 1942, Labor minister Edward Ward accused the previous Menzies and Fadden governments of having planned this strategy, though he had no evidence to support his claims. MacArthur’s mention of the “Brisbane Line” to reporters in March 1943 sparked further public concern and controversy. A Royal Commission  that operated from June to September 1943, however, determined that no such plan had ever existed as an official policy. Indeed, MacArthur decided that the best way to stop Japanese forces from advancing to Australia was to make a stand in New Guinea.","Meanwhile, on land, the fortunes of <a href=\"/topic/war\">war</a> turned against the Japanese in August–September 1942, beginning with an Allied (primarily Australian) victory at <a href=\"/place/Milne-Bay\">Milne Bay</a>, New Guinea. More prolonged—and of more heroic dimension in Australian eyes—was the forcing back of the Japanese from southern New Guinea over the Kokoda Track (or Trail), along which Australian soldiers put up strong resistance against seemingly overwhelming odds. The Japanese, having failed to capture <a href=\"/place/Port-Moresby\">Port Moresby</a> by sea in the <a href=\"/event/Battle-of-the-Coral-Sea\">Battle of the Coral Sea</a> (May 4–8, 1942), landed in northern New Guinea at the beachheads of Gona and Buna on July 21, 1942, with the intention of taking the New Guinea capital by pushing south over the rugged <a href=\"/place/Owen-Stanley-Range\">Owen Stanley Range</a> along the Kokoda Track. In a series of engagements during what proved to be a four-month campaign, Australian troops eventually forced their more powerful adversary to withdraw, retaking the Kokoda region on November 2, 1942. Their actions arguably saved Australia from Japanese invasion and, as such, formed a defining moment in Australian history. The endurance, courage, “mateship,” and never-give-up attitude the Australian soldiers displayed during the campaign fostered the so-called ANZAC <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legend\">legend</a>, the tradition of the indomitable spirit of Australian troops that began with the original<a href=\"/topic/ANZAC\"> ANZAC</a>s in the <a href=\"/event/Gallipoli-Campaign\">Gallipoli Campaign</a> of 1915 and continues today as an important element of national identity.","A long <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attrition\">attrition</a> of Japanese forces elsewhere in New Guinea and the islands followed the <a href=\"/event/Kokoda-Track-Campaign\">Kokoda Track Campaign</a>, with Australia initially playing a major role and subsequently playing a role secondary to American forces. Both Australian volunteers and conscripts fought in these campaigns, the government and people having accepted the legitimacy of sending conscripts as far north as the <a href=\"/place/Equator\">Equator</a> and as far west and east as the 110th and 159th <a href=\"/science/meridian-geography\">meridians</a>.","Because defeat in the Battles of the Coral Sea and <a href=\"/event/Battle-of-Midway\">Midway</a> prevented Japan from continuing to supply its forces in Burma (<a href=\"/place/Myanmar\">Myanmar</a>) by sea, the Japanese high command undertook the building of a rail line between <a href=\"/place/Thailand\">Thailand</a> and Burma. In addition to Asian labourers, more than 60,000 Allied <a href=\"/topic/prisoner-of-war\">prisoners of war</a> (POWs), including about 13,000 Australians, were forced to construct the 260-mile (415-km) Burma (Thai-Burma) Railway Line. Subject to cruel punishment and torture, the POWs also suffered from disease and malnutrition. As a result, more than one-fifth of them, including more than 2,800 Australians, died during the yearlong (October 1942–October 1943) construction of the railway. The will to survive exhibited by the Australian POWs—including Lieut. Col. <a href=\"/biography/Weary-Dunlop\">Ernest Edward (“Weary”) Dunlop</a>, an army surgeon who risked his life by standing up to his Japanese captors to protect the men in his care—contributed further to the ANZAC legend.","There were more than two dozen POW camps in Australia. On August 5, 1944, one of the largest POW breakouts in history occurred at the facility in <a href=\"/place/Cowra\">Cowra</a> in east-central New South Wales. In the wee hours of the morning, more than 1,100 Japanese POWs staged a mass breakout, storming the barbed-wire fence surrounding the camp. More than 300 prisoners managed to escape, but within nine days all of the escapees who had not chosen to kill themselves were recaptured. In all, 231 Japanese POWs died as a result of the breakout.","The war brought some passion into domestic affairs, <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/albeit\">albeit</a> less than in <a href=\"/event/World-War-I\">World War I</a>.

Urban employment was bountiful, and concentration in the state capitals became more marked than ever. Many families had two or more income earners. Thus, affluence quickened.

More women also joined the workforce to replace men who had left for war, bringing about a significant change in the traditional role of women, who had previously remained in the home to manage domestic responsibilities and raise children. As they became more active in society, women gained respect for the vital assistance they provided to improving sectors of Australian life."],"sections":[],"isFilled":true},{"level":4,"id":"ref42429","sidebarHeader":"The culture","header":"The culture","paragraphs":["The period produced not only <a href=\"/biography/Joseph-Furphy\">Joseph Furphy</a>’s <em>Such Is Life</em> (1903) but also the work of <a href=\"/biography/Henry-Handel-Richardson\">Henry Handel Richardson</a> (pseudonym of Ethel F.L.

The arrival and presence of over 100,000  U.S. troops in Australia from 1941 had a substantial impact on postwar culture and society. The American alliance with Australia during the war forged close ties between the two countries, and Australia came to depend on the United States for military support as well as economic growth. Prior to the war, Australian society had been largely influenced by conservative British culture, mirroring its entertainment, music, and sports as well as its social attitudes. By the end of the war a significant change was underway, however, and from the 1950s onward Australian lifestyles felt the dramatic impact of the new more rebellious culture of the United States, which had emerged from the war in a powerful economic position.","The strong cultural influence that the United States exerted over other Western countries, especially Australia, was profound. Because Australia also experienced an economic boom as a result of the war, its newfound affluent position enabled Australians to embrace innovative new and now more-affordable products and technologies, many of which were imported from the more industrialized United States. American ideals and cultural products, such as film and music, quickly dispersed throughout Australian society, with an accompanying move away from the traditional restricted ways of prewar life to a more liberated and expressive lifestyle.","Film-going had become one of the most popular pastimes for Australian people during World War II, as motion pictures provided a form of escapism from the horrors of the real wartime world. In 1945 alone, 151 million cinema admissions were recorded in Australia. Most of the films shown on Australian screens between the 1940s and ’50s, however, were produced by American companies. Australian-made films were in very short supply in the early 1950s. Many of the American films appealed to a teenage audience with their depiction of radical American social themes and ideals. This exposure undoubtedly had an impact upon impressionable adolescents, sparking the birth of a new youth culture in Australia.","The introduction of <a href=\"/topic/television-broadcasting\">television</a> in Australia in September 1956 provided a new cultural experience and resulted in a dramatic decline in cinema attendance. Television quickly became one of the most popular forms of entertainment and one of the most influential mediums in the country. The Australian government had been determined to have the country’s first television network up and running in time for the Melbourne Olympic Games, and it met this objective with some two months to spare.","In the initial years after television’s arrival, not many Australians could afford the new technology.  However, as televisions became less expensive, the number of Australians who owned a television rapidly increased. Despite the enormous popularity of television, a small proportion of society opposed it, mainly because the majority of programs were American productions. With more than 80 percent of television content sourced from the United States, it was feared that American content, themes, and culture would impede the development of the Australian identity. This concern was <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alleviated\">alleviated</a> somewhat when the demand for an increase in Australian content led to the broadcasting of more Australian programs in the mid-1960s, particularly Australian dramatic series.","The proliferation of vinyl records after World War II had a major impact on the experience of music in Australia and revolutionized the music industry. By the early 1960s more than 500,000 records were being manufactured every month in Australia. This spike in record production coincided with the explosion of rebellious youth-oriented culture, sparked by the rise of <a href=\"/art/rock-and-roll-early-style-of-rock-music\">rock and roll</a>, the arrival of which in Australia is usually dated to the theatrical release in 1955 of <a href=\"/topic/Blackboard-Jungle\"></a>; the movie featured the hit single “Rock Around the Clock” by the American band <a href=\"/biography/Bill-Haley\">Bill Haley</a> and <a href=\"/topic/Bill-Haley-and-His-Comets\">His Comets</a>, whose Australian tour in 1957 was a sensation.

With the exciting new music came the creation of expressive new dance styles and trendy youthful clothing. Put off by the accompanying changes in behaviour, fashion, and attitudes, some in the older generation blamed rock and roll for the rise in <a href=\"/topic/delinquency\">juvenile delinquency</a>.

Yet in 1946 the ALP government initiated a policy that assisted the entry not only of people from the United Kingdom but also of many others from war-distressed <a href=\"/place/Europe\">Europe</a>. The peak year of net immigration (about 150,000) was 1950, while the greatest numbers of assisted migrants (about 100,000 per annum) came in the later 1960s. While it has been modified many times, this overall policy has remained in place. Closer ties with Australia’s Asian neighbours, however, moved toward abandoning the policy of virtual exclusion of “coloured” immigrants. From the late 1960s such restrictions were eased. The acceptance of refugees from <a href=\"/place/Indochina\">Indochina</a> was the most <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/palpable\">palpable</a> evidence of the new policy.

Continuing debate pondered the relative merits of “<a href=\"/topic/assimilation-society\">assimilation</a>” as against “<a href=\"/topic/multiculturalism\">multiculturalism</a>”—i.e., minimizing or encouraging the migrants’ retention of their native customs. Especially after 1970 the latter policy had official favour, but migration had surprisingly only marginal impact on established sociopolitical structures. Many tongues were heard and many cuisines eaten, but suburban living near the big cities was as compelling a goal for most migrants as for their Anglo-Celtic forerunners, and their values were shaped accordingly.

It found formal expression in a new <a href=\"/topic/political-party\">political party</a>, the <a href=\"/topic/Australian-Democrats\">Australian Democrats</a>, which was founded in 1977 and succeeded to the Democratic Labor Party’s role as a minority party of significant effect. The new radicalism also helped shape thought and action in other, more diffuse, ways.","<a href=\"/topic/Australian-Aboriginal\">Aboriginal</a> activism became more assertive than it had been since the days of physical attack on European settlers. The estimated number of persons of Aboriginal descent had risen from a nadir of 73,828 in 1933 to more than 170,000 in the early 1980s; in 1962, Aboriginal people received the franchise and, for the first time, were to be counted in the national census. Aboriginal claims moved from wage equality with Europeans to land rights over territory with Aboriginal associations. The South Australian government acted in this direction from 1966, and the federal Aboriginal Land Rights Act (1976), applying to the Northern Territory, was particularly important. In 1967 the general electorate overwhelmingly supported a constitutional <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amendment\">amendment</a> to increase Commonwealth powers in Aboriginal matters. Equality in formal civic rights, wage payments, and social welfare benefits became the norm. Some groups received considerable royalties from mining activities on their land.","The Whitlam government in particular encouraged a variety of ethnic organizations, most importantly the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee (founded in 1973, from 1977 renamed the National Aboriginal Conference). These organizations contributed to a growing strength and pride in Aboriginality. Early in the period, Aboriginal persons became known for their contributions to sport (boxer <a href=\"/biography/Lionel-Rose\">Lionel Rose</a>, tennis player <a href=\"/biography/Evonne-Goolagong-Cawley\">Evonne Goolagong Cawley</a>). Later, Aboriginal persons became celebrated in the fields of <a href=\"/topic/public-administration\">public administration</a> (Charles Perkins, Patricia O’Shane), art (Yirawala, Michael Jagamara Nelson, Emily Kngwarreye), <a href=\"/art/literature\">literature</a> (<a href=\"/biography/Oodgeroo-Noonuccal\">Kath Walker</a>, <a href=\"/biography/Colin-Johnson\">Colin Johnson</a>, <a href=\"/biography/Sally-Morgan\">Sally Morgan</a>), and politics (Neville Thomas Bonner, senator, 1971–83, and Aden Ridgeway, senator from 1999).","While various researchers had been expanding knowledge of the antiquity and richness of Aboriginal life, not all Aboriginal people accepted the right and capacity of white scholars to comprehend the tribal past, but this attitude itself affirmed their independence. School curricula began to provide sympathetic teaching of Aboriginal culture to all Australians. Such policies reinforced a shift away from assimilationist ideas. This shift applied nationwide but had particular relevance in sustaining the surviving remnants of tribal life. In the late 20th century the number of Aboriginal persons with some experience of traditional Aboriginal life was estimated to be about 10,000.","Increased awareness of past depredations against Aboriginal peoples helped shape a wider-ranging <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/critique\">critique</a> of the Australian experience. Dissidents influenced by the New Marxism of the later 1960s (notably Humphrey McQueen in his <em>A New Britannia</em>, first published in 1970) saw the nation as ever dominated by petty bourgeois standards—mean, acquisitive, racist, and authoritarian. Many earlier commentators had perceived such traits, but now they were attacked with more fundamental repugnance. The dismissal of Whitlam in 1975 encouraged the belief that essentially Australia was not a democracy and that it suffered much from a heritage of subservience to <a href=\"/place/British-Empire\">British</a> imperial standards. While this radical critique lost some acerbity after 1980, it left an impression, especially on the liberal intelligentsia. One result was greater emphasis on the dignity and autonomy of Australian-centred <a href=\"/topic/cultural-studies\">cultural studies</a>. <a href=\"/biography/Robert-Hughes\">Robert Hughes’s</a> <em>The Fatal Shore: The Epic of Australia’s Founding</em> (1987), a vivid account of the experiences of both transported convicts and colonists that became an international <a href=\"/topic/best-seller\">best seller</a>, explored Australia’s origins as a colony and its search for a national identity.","<a href=\"/science/conservation-ecology\">Environmental activism</a> developed, often spurred by repugnance to the exploitative development that radicals saw, with much truth, as central to Australian history since 1788. Some aspects of <a href=\"/topic/environmentalism\">environmentalism</a> gained support across a wide spectrum. Most state governments introduced controls about 1970. There was a particularly emotional campaign to save beautiful Lake Pedder in <a href=\"/place/Tasmania\">Tasmania</a> from conversion into a hydroelectric dam. The campaign failed in 1973, but in that year the federal government established an inquiry into the national estate, from which resulted the Australian Heritage Commission Act in 1975. In 1982 the High Court agreed that the Commonwealth had power to override states on environmental matters should the issue in question come within the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/purview\">purview</a> of an international <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/covenant\">covenant</a> to which Australia was a party. Environmentalists have exercised considerable influence as pressure groups and have made some essays into parliamentary politics: in 1989 a “Green” group acquired the <a href=\"/topic/balance-of-power\">balance of power</a> in <a href=\"/place/Tasmania\">Tasmania</a>, aided by the system of proportional representation prevailing there. While Australia contributed only a little to the mainstream of environmental theory, <a href=\"/biography/Peter-Singer\">Peter Singer</a> of Monash University won international renown for his exposition of <a href=\"/topic/animal-rights\">animal rights</a>.","Miriam Dixson in <em>The Real Matilda</em> (1976) argued that Australian <a href=\"/topic/women\">women</a> had suffered an inferior status, markedly below that of women in Western society at large. Her case was arguable, but the increasing volume of feminist studies more often stressed the achievements of women, though often against great odds, in many sectors of society and culture. Feminists played an important part in the expansion of Australian studies; women increased their share in Australian literary work, often writing on feminist themes. <a href=\"/biography/Germaine-Greer\">Germaine Greer</a>, born in Melbourne, achieved eminence for her writings.","The number of women physicians and lawyers in Australia rose significantly, but more sizable still was the impact of women in the public service. Some succeeded in federal politics, and a greater number at the state level: in 1990 Carmen Lawrence (in <a href=\"/place/Western-Australia\">Western Australia</a>) and Joan Kirner (in <a href=\"/place/Victoria-state-Australia\">Victoria</a>) were the first women to become leaders of governments.","<a href=\"/topic/gay-rights-movement\">Gay</a> and <a href=\"/topic/lesbian-feminism\">lesbian</a> activism followed much the same path in Australia as elsewhere; Sydney was said to have become one of the major “gay” cities of the world.

It confirmed that Australia was already occupied in a manner recognizable under British law when the first white settlers arrived.

The resulting <a href=\"/topic/Native-Title-Act\">Native Title Act</a> (1993) was unsuccessfully challenged, and subsequently, under its judgment in 1996 (the Wik case), the High Court decided that Indigenous title and pastoral leasehold could coexist. Aboriginal descent became a matter of pride, and by the early 21st century the number affirming themselves to be Aboriginal was some half million.","Meanwhile, despite such advances, the bleakness of much Aboriginal experience remained stark and disturbing—illness, alcoholism, and violence all having their part. The many deaths of Aboriginal men while in official custody added to such feeling, and still more so invocation of the long history of Aboriginal families being forcibly separated. While all governments upheld the desirability of racial reconciliation, they remained reluctant to make a formal apology for past wrongs.","Debate as to constitutional change quickened in the late 1990s, many seeing the time as opportune for a shift to republican status. However, when the matter came to <a href=\"/topic/referendum\">referendum</a> vote in 1999, republicans divided over how radical their intended change should be.

In a historic address on February 13, 2008, Rudd issued a formal apology to <a href=\"/topic/Australian-Aboriginal\">Aboriginal</a> peoples for abuses they had suffered under early Australian administrations.","In 2009 the linchpin of Rudd’s environmental <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/initiative\">initiative</a>, the <a href=\"/technology/emissions-trading\">Emissions Trading</a> Scheme, failed to gain passage, and, when he withdrew the legislation in 2010, his action was criticized in some quarters as timid. Rudd’s hold on power was further threatened by strident opposition from business groups to the controversial Resource Super Profits Tax, a proposal targeted at the mining industry and scheduled to go into effect in 2012. Support for Rudd within the Labor Party waned so much that he did not even contest a leadership vote in June 2010 in which <a href=\"/biography/Julia-Gillard\">Julia Gillard</a> replaced him as party leader. She became Australia’s first woman prime minister.","Shortly after taking office, Gillard called for a new election, which took place in late August (<em>see</em> <a href=\"/topic/2010-1701953\">Australian federal election of 2010</a>). The results were extremely close, and neither Labor nor the Liberals won an outright majority in the House of Representatives.

The motives for this move have become a matter of some controversy. The traditional view is that Britain thereby sought to relieve the pressure upon its <a href=\"/topic/penal-colony\">prisons</a>—a pressure intensified by the loss of its American colonies, which until that time had accepted transported felons. This view is supported by the fact that convicts went to the settlement from the outset and that official statements put this first among the colony’s intended purposes. But some historians have argued that this glossed a scheme to provide a <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bastion\">bastion</a> for British <a href=\"/topic/sea-power\">sea power</a> in the eastern seas. Some have seen a purely strategic purpose in settlement, but others have postulated an intent to use the colony as a springboard for economic exploitation of the area. It is very likely that the government had some interest in all these factors.","Whatever the deeper motivation, plans went ahead, with Lord Sydney (Thomas Townshend), secretary of state for home affairs, as the guiding authority. <a href=\"/biography/Arthur-Phillip\">Arthur Phillip</a> was commander of the expedition; he was to take possession of the whole territory from <a href=\"/place/Cape-York\">Cape York</a> to <a href=\"/place/Tasmania\">Tasmania</a>, westward as far as 135° and eastward to include <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adjacent\">adjacent</a> islands. Phillip’s power was to be near absolute within his domain. The British government planned to develop the region’s economy by employing convict labour on government farms, while former convicts would subsist on their own small plots.","The First Fleet sailed on May 13, 1787, with 11 vessels, including 6 transports, aboard which were about 730 convicts (570 men and 160 women). More than 250 free persons accompanied the convicts, chiefly marines of various rank. The fleet reached <a href=\"/place/Botany-Bay\">Botany Bay</a> on January 19–20, 1788. Crisis threatened at once. The Botany Bay area had poor soil and little water, and the harbour itself was inferior. Phillip therefore sailed northward on January 21 and entered a superb harbour, <a href=\"/place/Port-Jackson\">Port Jackson</a>, which Cook had marked but not explored. He moved the fleet there; the flag was hoisted on January 26 and the formalities of government begun on February 7. Sydney Cove, the focus of settlement, was deep within Port Jackson, on the southern side; around it was to grow the city of <a href=\"/place/Sydney-New-South-Wales\">Sydney</a>.","Phillip at once established an outstation at <a href=\"/place/Norfolk-Island\">Norfolk Island</a>.

Farmers and graziers began to fill out an arc 150–200 miles around Sydney; this area was designated as the Nineteen Counties in 1829, and settlement beyond that limit was discouraged.","Following the discovery of Bass Strait, and in order to secure southern waterways, new settlements were established in the south. From Britain, <a href=\"/biography/David-Collins\">David Collins</a> sailed in 1803 to settle <a href=\"/place/Port-Phillip-District\">Port Phillip</a>. His sojourn there was unhappy, and in mid-1804 he moved to the <a href=\"/place/River-Derwent-river-Tasmania-Australia\">River Derwent</a> in southern <a href=\"/place/Tasmania\">Tasmania</a>, already settled (September 1803) by a group from Sydney under <a href=\"/biography/John-Bowen\">John Bowen</a>.

Among penal outstations settled from Sydney were those at <a href=\"/place/Newcastle-New-South-Wales\">Newcastle</a> (1804) and <a href=\"/place/Moreton-Bay\">Moreton Bay</a> (1824), the forerunner of <a href=\"/place/Brisbane\">Brisbane</a>. <a href=\"/place/British-Empire\">Britain</a> extended its possession over the whole of the continent in the 1820s, again fearing French (or even American) intervention. The western boundary of the governor’s commission shifted to 129° in 1825 to include <a href=\"/place/Bathurst-New-South-Wales\">Bathurst</a> and Melville islands in the far north, and there was a small settlement in this region (1824–29). At Western Port, east of Port Phillip, another settlement was made (1826–27), while in January 1827 <a href=\"/biography/Edmund-Lockyer\">Edmund Lockyer</a> began permanent settlement at <a href=\"/place/Albany-Western-Australia\">Albany</a>, Western Australia. His instructions stated that Britain now claimed all Australia.","As remarked above, the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constitutional\">constitutional</a> structure was authoritarian. The governors were all service officers. There were no representative institutions, but Acts introduced in 1823 and 1828 provided for executive and legislative councils, with the major officers of government serving in both and an equal number of private individuals, chosen by nomination, in the latter. More significant at this stage was the articulation of a <a href=\"/topic/judiciary\">judicial system</a>, especially the establishment of supreme courts (New South Wales, 1814; Tasmania, 1824); normal trial by jury did not obtain.","Within this rigid structure, sociopolitical factions developed. Most important in the early years was the assertion of the <a href=\"/topic/New-South-Wales-Corps\">New South Wales Corps</a>, stationed at Sydney from 1791. Some officers of the corps sought power and profit with an avidity that led to clash after clash with the early governors. This culminated in the events of January 26, 1808, when <a href=\"/biography/John-Macarthur\">John Macarthur</a>, a former officer of the corps, led an uprising known as the <a href=\"/event/Rum-Rebellion\">Rum Rebellion</a> that deposed Governor <a href=\"/biography/William-Bligh\">William Bligh</a> (served 1806–08), earlier famous for the <em>Bounty</em> mutiny. In due course the imperial government reacted and recalled the corps; but Governor <a href=\"/biography/Lachlan-Macquarie\">Lachlan Macquarie</a> (served 1810–21) also clashed with the colony’s <a href=\"/topic/Exclusive-Australian-history\">Exclusives</a>—former officers and a handful of wealthy free immigrants. Macquarie associated himself with the <a href=\"/topic/Emancipist\">Emancipist</a> faction, a group that argued in favour of former convicts having a particular claim upon government and the colony’s resources.","Macquarie’s attitude disturbed the imperial government. After an official inquiry (1819–21) by John Thomas Bigge, the government encouraged the migration of men of some standing and wealth to both New South Wales and Tasmania. Such men received substantial grants of land and appeared to be the natural leaders of social and economic development. The Emancipists continued to be strong, however, especially through the leadership of <a href=\"/biography/W-C-Wentworth\">William Charles Wentworth</a> (himself the son of a convict woman), whose newspaper, the <em>Australian</em> (founded 1824), was the spearhead of opposition, especially to Governor Ralph Darling (served 1825–31). In Tasmania factions never formed so clearly, but there, also, the press led <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/criticism\">criticism</a> of the government.","By 1830 about 58,000 <a href=\"/topic/penal-colony\">convicts</a>, including almost 50,000 men, had come to Australia (the rate increasing rapidly after 1815). Many were urban thieves. There were a few political prisoners, while a substantial proportion of the Irish convicts (at least a third of the total) had become offenders through sociopolitical unrest. In Australia the convicts were either employed by the government or “assigned” to private employers. In general, conditions were not especially harsh or repressive, and “tickets of leave” and pardons provided relatively quick routes to freedom. Assignment to the new settlers of the 1820s, however, often had an element of slavery, and many convicts must have suffered grief and despair in their exile. Most convicts committed some further misdeeds, although only about one-tenth were charged with serious offenses. Those found guilty went to secondary penal stations, the (sometimes exaggerated) horror spots of Australian history—<a href=\"/place/Macquarie-Harbour\">Macquarie Harbour</a>, <a href=\"/place/Newcastle-New-South-Wales\">Newcastle</a>, and <a href=\"/place/Moreton-Bay\">Moreton Bay</a> in this period and, later, <a href=\"/place/Norfolk-Island\">Norfolk Island</a> and <a href=\"/place/Port-Arthur-inlet-Tasmania-Australia\">Port Arthur</a>. The convicts gave Australia a <em>Lumpenproletariat</em>; but success stories were common enough, and many convicts led decent lives. There were only a few large-scale protests; the most remarkable was the <a href=\"/event/Castle-Hill-Rising\">Castle Hill Rising</a> among Irish convicts outside Sydney in March 1804. Altogether, the impact of such a large convict population was less grim and ugly than might be expected.","The maintenance of convicts was essentially the economic resource of the colony for many years; this function entailed very considerable expenditure by the British government. Wealth was won by supplying government stores with food and grain or by controlling internal trade—or both. The officers of the New South Wales Corps were skilled in filling these roles, although civil officers, private settlers, former convicts, and even serving convicts all had their own means of doing business, and the amount of petty commercial activity was large. Farming was pursued on a widely ranging scale. <a href=\"/biography/John-Macarthur\">John Macarthur</a> was the most notable of those who early believed that <a href=\"/topic/wool\">wool</a> growing would be a major economic resource; he himself received a substantial land grant in 1805 to pursue this hope, and he persuaded Bigge of its validity. By 1830 these hopes were still some distance from fulfillment: sheep long returned more value from their meat than from their wool, and the breeding of wooled sheep suitable to the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environment\">environment</a> took time. The 1820s saw that process quickening, with relatively greater strength in Tasmania. <a href=\"/topic/sealing-hunting\">Sealing</a> and <a href=\"/topic/whaling\">whaling</a> also proved profitable, although the richest seal fields (especially in Bass Strait) were soon thinned; and not until the 1820s did colonists have the wealth to engage seriously in whaling, although British and Americans early used Australian ports for this purpose. Maritime adventure led early colonists to make contact with Pacific islands, most importantly Tahiti.","The period saw some notable exploration by land. From early days in Sydney settlers sought a way over the mountains, some 50–100 miles west. The task was accomplished in 1813; the young Wentworth led the party. A surveyor, <a href=\"/biography/George-William-Evans\">George William Evans</a>, followed their route to Bathurst (founded 1815) and reported rich pastoral country. <a href=\"/biography/John-Oxley\">John Oxley</a> further mapped the inland plains and rivers, especially the Lachlan and Macquarie, and also explored the southern coasts of the future Queensland (1823), while <a href=\"/biography/Allan-Cunningham-Scottish-poet\">Allan Cunningham</a> was the great pioneer of that state’s hinterland (1827). Meanwhile, in 1824–25, <a href=\"/biography/Hamilton-Hume\">Hamilton Hume</a> and William Hovell went overland southward to the western shore of Port Phillip. <a href=\"/biography/Charles-Sturt\">Charles Sturt</a> in 1828–30 won still greater fame by tracing the Murray-Murrumbidgee-Darling river system down to the Murray’s mouth.","The writings of explorers and pioneers were Australia’s first contributions to literary culture. While catering to the European appetite for natural history, they sometimes achieved literary grace. Pictorial illustrations of the new land, some by convicts, also dated from the earliest years. <a href=\"/biography/David-Collins\">David Collins’s</a> <em>An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales</em> (1798) and <a href=\"/biography/W-C-Wentworth\">Wentworth’s</a> <em>Description of New South Wales</em> (1817) were literate, informed, and impressive. Wentworth showed skill as a versifier, too, especially in his <em>Australasia</em> (1823). Newspapers were founded as early as 1803, and they contributed to cultural as well as political history.

The act made allowance for further revision of the colonial constitutions, and in 1855–56 this took effect in the four colonies, Tasmania then abandoning the name Van Diemen’s Land. Queensland followed after its separation from New South Wales. All had bicameral legislatures, with ministers responsible to the lower houses, which by 1860, except in Tasmania, were elected on a near-democratic basis (all adult non-Aboriginal men were eligible to vote). In Victoria and South Australia the secret ballot was introduced in 1856 (<em>see</em> <a href=\"/topic/Australian-ballot\">Australian ballot</a>).","While the imperial power thus responded to colonial cries for self-rule, on the way there were some tense moments.

Thus, grants of land ceased in 1831, replaced by sale. Attempts to create a pastoral-lease system caused much friction, with colonists generally hostile to any demand for payment. In New South Wales in 1844, new regulations even prompted talk of rebellion.","With regard to labour, colonists agreed with imperial encouragement of free migration, but friction arose over the <a href=\"/topic/penal-colony\">convicts</a>. British opinion in the 1830s became increasingly critical of the assignment of convicts to private employers as smacking of slavery; it was abolished in 1840, and with it transportation of convicts to the mainland virtually ceased, although increased numbers were sent to Tasmania. The end of assignment removed the chief virtue of transportation, from the colonists’ viewpoint, and so contributed to a vigorous movement against its continuation. The British government ended transportation to eastern Australia in 1852. In Western Australia transportation began in 1850, at the colonists’ behest, and continued until 1868.

Several other navigators, including merchantmen, filled out knowledge of the <a href=\"/place/Bass-Strait\">Bass Strait</a> area; most notable was the discovery of Port Phillip in 1802.","Meanwhile Flinders had returned home and in 1801 was appointed to command an expedition that would circumnavigate Australia and virtually complete the charting of the <a href=\"/science/continent\">continent</a>.

The motives for this move have become a matter of some controversy. The traditional view is that Britain thereby sought to relieve the pressure upon its <a href=\"/topic/penal-colony\">prisons</a>—a pressure intensified by the loss of its American colonies, which until that time had accepted transported felons. This view is supported by the fact that convicts went to the settlement from the outset and that official statements put this first among the colony’s intended purposes. But some historians have argued that this glossed a scheme to provide a <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bastion\">bastion</a> for British <a href=\"/topic/sea-power\">sea power</a> in the eastern seas. Some have seen a purely strategic purpose in settlement, but others have postulated an intent to use the colony as a springboard for economic exploitation of the area. It is very likely that the government had some interest in all these factors.","Whatever the deeper motivation, plans went ahead, with Lord Sydney (Thomas Townshend), secretary of state for home affairs, as the guiding authority. <a href=\"/biography/Arthur-Phillip\">Arthur Phillip</a> was commander of the expedition; he was to take possession of the whole territory from <a href=\"/place/Cape-York\">Cape York</a> to <a href=\"/place/Tasmania\">Tasmania</a>, westward as far as 135° and eastward to include <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adjacent\">adjacent</a> islands. Phillip’s power was to be near absolute within his domain. The British government planned to develop the region’s economy by employing convict labour on government farms, while former convicts would subsist on their own small plots.","The First Fleet sailed on May 13, 1787, with 11 vessels, including 6 transports, aboard which were about 730 convicts (570 men and 160 women). More than 250 free persons accompanied the convicts, chiefly marines of various rank. The fleet reached <a href=\"/place/Botany-Bay\">Botany Bay</a> on January 19–20, 1788. Crisis threatened at once. The Botany Bay area had poor soil and little water, and the harbour itself was inferior. Phillip therefore sailed northward on January 21 and entered a superb harbour, <a href=\"/place/Port-Jackson\">Port Jackson</a>, which Cook had marked but not explored. He moved the fleet there; the flag was hoisted on January 26 and the formalities of government begun on February 7. Sydney Cove, the focus of settlement, was deep within Port Jackson, on the southern side; around it was to grow the city of <a href=\"/place/Sydney-New-South-Wales\">Sydney</a>.","Phillip at once established an outstation at <a href=\"/place/Norfolk-Island\">Norfolk Island</a>. Its history was to be checkered; settlement was abandoned in 1813 and revived in 1825 to provide a jail for convicts who misbehaved in Australia. (It served a new purpose from 1856 as a home for the descendants of the mutineers of the HMS <em>Bounty</em>, by then too numerous for <a href=\"/place/Pitcairn-Island\">Pitcairn Island</a>.)","Phillip remained as governor until December 1792, seeing New South Wales through its darkest days. The land was indifferent, disease and pests abounded, few convicts proved able labourers, and Aboriginal people were often hostile. The nadir came in autumn 1790 as supplies shrank; the arrival of a second fleet brought hundreds of sickly convicts but also the means of survival."],"sections":[],"isFilled":true},{"level":4,"id":"ref42401","sidebarHeader":"An authoritarian society","header":"An authoritarian society","paragraphs":["While much change proceeded throughout this period, <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/authoritarian\">authoritarian</a> and hierarchical elements remained strong. The reception of convicts continued and was a major fact in social and economic life. <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Entrepreneurs\">Entrepreneurs</a> strove hard but did not yet develop a staple industry. Farmers and graziers began to fill out an arc 150–200 miles around Sydney; this area was designated as the Nineteen Counties in 1829, and settlement beyond that limit was discouraged.","Following the discovery of Bass Strait, and in order to secure southern waterways, new settlements were established in the south. From Britain, <a href=\"/biography/David-Collins\">David Collins</a> sailed in 1803 to settle <a href=\"/place/Port-Phillip-District\">Port Phillip</a>. His sojourn there was unhappy, and in mid-1804 he moved to the <a href=\"/place/River-Derwent-river-Tasmania-Australia\">River Derwent</a> in southern <a href=\"/place/Tasmania\">Tasmania</a>, already settled (September 1803) by a group from Sydney under <a href=\"/biography/John-Bowen\">John Bowen</a>. Collins resettled the amalgamated parties at <a href=\"/place/Hobart-Tasmania-Australia\">Hobart</a>. In November 1804 <a href=\"/biography/William-Paterson-British-explorer\">William Paterson</a> founded a settlement in northern Tasmania, the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/precursor\">precursor</a> of <a href=\"/place/Launceston-Tasmania-Australia\">Launceston</a>. These settlements united in 1812; they were still under supervision from Sydney, although only nominally from 1825. Among penal outstations settled from Sydney were those at <a href=\"/place/Newcastle-New-South-Wales\">Newcastle</a> (1804) and <a href=\"/place/Moreton-Bay\">Moreton Bay</a> (1824), the forerunner of <a href=\"/place/Brisbane\">Brisbane</a>. <a href=\"/place/British-Empire\">Britain</a> extended its possession over the whole of the continent in the 1820s, again fearing French (or even American) intervention. The western boundary of the governor’s commission shifted to 129° in 1825 to include <a href=\"/place/Bathurst-New-South-Wales\">Bathurst</a> and Melville islands in the far north, and there was a small settlement in this region (1824–29). At Western Port, east of Port Phillip, another settlement was made (1826–27), while in January 1827 <a href=\"/biography/Edmund-Lockyer\">Edmund Lockyer</a> began permanent settlement at <a href=\"/place/Albany-Western-Australia\">Albany</a>, Western Australia. His instructions stated that Britain now claimed all Australia.","As remarked above, the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constitutional\">constitutional</a> structure was authoritarian. The governors were all service officers. There were no representative institutions, but Acts introduced in 1823 and 1828 provided for executive and legislative councils, with the major officers of government serving in both and an equal number of private individuals, chosen by nomination, in the latter. More significant at this stage was the articulation of a <a href=\"/topic/judiciary\">judicial system</a>, especially the establishment of supreme courts (New South Wales, 1814; Tasmania, 1824); normal trial by jury did not obtain.","Within this rigid structure, sociopolitical factions developed. Most important in the early years was the assertion of the <a href=\"/topic/New-South-Wales-Corps\">New South Wales Corps</a>, stationed at Sydney from 1791. Some officers of the corps sought power and profit with an avidity that led to clash after clash with the early governors. This culminated in the events of January 26, 1808, when <a href=\"/biography/John-Macarthur\">John Macarthur</a>, a former officer of the corps, led an uprising known as the <a href=\"/event/Rum-Rebellion\">Rum Rebellion</a> that deposed Governor <a href=\"/biography/William-Bligh\">William Bligh</a> (served 1806–08), earlier famous for the <em>Bounty</em> mutiny. In due course the imperial government reacted and recalled the corps; but Governor <a href=\"/biography/Lachlan-Macquarie\">Lachlan Macquarie</a> (served 1810–21) also clashed with the colony’s <a href=\"/topic/Exclusive-Australian-history\">Exclusives</a>—former officers and a handful of wealthy free immigrants. Macquarie associated himself with the <a href=\"/topic/Emancipist\">Emancipist</a> faction, a group that argued in favour of former convicts having a particular claim upon government and the colony’s resources.","Macquarie’s attitude disturbed the imperial government. After an official inquiry (1819–21) by John Thomas Bigge, the government encouraged the migration of men of some standing and wealth to both New South Wales and Tasmania. Such men received substantial grants of land and appeared to be the natural leaders of social and economic development. The Emancipists continued to be strong, however, especially through the leadership of <a href=\"/biography/W-C-Wentworth\">William Charles Wentworth</a> (himself the son of a convict woman), whose newspaper, the <em>Australian</em> (founded 1824), was the spearhead of opposition, especially to Governor Ralph Darling (served 1825–31). In Tasmania factions never formed so clearly, but there, also, the press led <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/criticism\">criticism</a> of the government.","By 1830 about 58,000 <a href=\"/topic/penal-colony\">convicts</a>, including almost 50,000 men, had come to Australia (the rate increasing rapidly after 1815). Many were urban thieves. There were a few political prisoners, while a substantial proportion of the Irish convicts (at least a third of the total) had become offenders through sociopolitical unrest. In Australia the convicts were either employed by the government or “assigned” to private employers. In general, conditions were not especially harsh or repressive, and “tickets of leave” and pardons provided relatively quick routes to freedom. Assignment to the new settlers of the 1820s, however, often had an element of slavery, and many convicts must have suffered grief and despair in their exile. Most convicts committed some further misdeeds, although only about one-tenth were charged with serious offenses. Those found guilty went to secondary penal stations, the (sometimes exaggerated) horror spots of Australian history—<a href=\"/place/Macquarie-Harbour\">Macquarie Harbour</a>, <a href=\"/place/Newcastle-New-South-Wales\">Newcastle</a>, and <a href=\"/place/Moreton-Bay\">Moreton Bay</a> in this period and, later, <a href=\"/place/Norfolk-Island\">Norfolk Island</a> and <a href=\"/place/Port-Arthur-inlet-Tasmania-Australia\">Port Arthur</a>. The convicts gave Australia a <em>Lumpenproletariat</em>; but success stories were common enough, and many convicts led decent lives. There were only a few large-scale protests; the most remarkable was the <a href=\"/event/Castle-Hill-Rising\">Castle Hill Rising</a> among Irish convicts outside Sydney in March 1804. Altogether, the impact of such a large convict population was less grim and ugly than might be expected.","The maintenance of convicts was essentially the economic resource of the colony for many years; this function entailed very considerable expenditure by the British government. Wealth was won by supplying government stores with food and grain or by controlling internal trade—or both. The officers of the New South Wales Corps were skilled in filling these roles, although civil officers, private settlers, former convicts, and even serving convicts all had their own means of doing business, and the amount of petty commercial activity was large. Farming was pursued on a widely ranging scale. <a href=\"/biography/John-Macarthur\">John Macarthur</a> was the most notable of those who early believed that <a href=\"/topic/wool\">wool</a> growing would be a major economic resource; he himself received a substantial land grant in 1805 to pursue this hope, and he persuaded Bigge of its validity. By 1830 these hopes were still some distance from fulfillment: sheep long returned more value from their meat than from their wool, and the breeding of wooled sheep suitable to the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environment\">environment</a> took time. The 1820s saw that process quickening, with relatively greater strength in Tasmania. <a href=\"/topic/sealing-hunting\">Sealing</a> and <a href=\"/topic/whaling\">whaling</a> also proved profitable, although the richest seal fields (especially in Bass Strait) were soon thinned; and not until the 1820s did colonists have the wealth to engage seriously in whaling, although British and Americans early used Australian ports for this purpose. Maritime adventure led early colonists to make contact with Pacific islands, most importantly Tahiti.","The period saw some notable exploration by land. From early days in Sydney settlers sought a way over the mountains, some 50–100 miles west. The task was accomplished in 1813; the young Wentworth led the party. A surveyor, <a href=\"/biography/George-William-Evans\">George William Evans</a>, followed their route to Bathurst (founded 1815) and reported rich pastoral country. <a href=\"/biography/John-Oxley\">John Oxley</a> further mapped the inland plains and rivers, especially the Lachlan and Macquarie, and also explored the southern coasts of the future Queensland (1823), while <a href=\"/biography/Allan-Cunningham-Scottish-poet\">Allan Cunningham</a> was the great pioneer of that state’s hinterland (1827). Meanwhile, in 1824–25, <a href=\"/biography/Hamilton-Hume\">Hamilton Hume</a> and William Hovell went overland southward to the western shore of Port Phillip. <a href=\"/biography/Charles-Sturt\">Charles Sturt</a> in 1828–30 won still greater fame by tracing the Murray-Murrumbidgee-Darling river system down to the Murray’s mouth.","The writings of explorers and pioneers were Australia’s first contributions to literary culture. While catering to the European appetite for natural history, they sometimes achieved literary grace. Pictorial illustrations of the new land, some by convicts, also dated from the earliest years. <a href=\"/biography/David-Collins\">David Collins’s</a> <em>An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales</em> (1798) and <a href=\"/biography/W-C-Wentworth\">Wentworth’s</a> <em>Description of New South Wales</em> (1817) were literate, informed, and impressive. Wentworth showed skill as a versifier, too, especially in his <em>Australasia</em> (1823). Newspapers were founded as early as 1803, and they contributed to cultural as well as political history. Outstanding was the architecture of <a href=\"/biography/Francis-Greenway\">Francis Greenway</a>, a former convict, who, under Macquarie’s patronage, designed churches and public buildings that remain among the most beautiful in Australia."],"sections":[],"isFilled":true}],"isFilled":true},"ref42393":{"level":4,"id":"ref42393","sidebarHeader":"Early contacts and approaches","header":"Early contacts and approaches","paragraphs":["Prior to documented history, travelers from Asia may have reached Australia.

The motives for this move have become a matter of some controversy. The traditional view is that Britain thereby sought to relieve the pressure upon its <a href=\"/topic/penal-colony\">prisons</a>—a pressure intensified by the loss of its American colonies, which until that time had accepted transported felons. This view is supported by the fact that convicts went to the settlement from the outset and that official statements put this first among the colony’s intended purposes. But some historians have argued that this glossed a scheme to provide a <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bastion\">bastion</a> for British <a href=\"/topic/sea-power\">sea power</a> in the eastern seas. Some have seen a purely strategic purpose in settlement, but others have postulated an intent to use the colony as a springboard for economic exploitation of the area. It is very likely that the government had some interest in all these factors.","Whatever the deeper motivation, plans went ahead, with Lord Sydney (Thomas Townshend), secretary of state for home affairs, as the guiding authority. <a href=\"/biography/Arthur-Phillip\">Arthur Phillip</a> was commander of the expedition; he was to take possession of the whole territory from <a href=\"/place/Cape-York\">Cape York</a> to <a href=\"/place/Tasmania\">Tasmania</a>, westward as far as 135° and eastward to include <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adjacent\">adjacent</a> islands. Phillip’s power was to be near absolute within his domain. The British government planned to develop the region’s economy by employing convict labour on government farms, while former convicts would subsist on their own small plots.","The First Fleet sailed on May 13, 1787, with 11 vessels, including 6 transports, aboard which were about 730 convicts (570 men and 160 women). More than 250 free persons accompanied the convicts, chiefly marines of various rank. The fleet reached <a href=\"/place/Botany-Bay\">Botany Bay</a> on January 19–20, 1788. Crisis threatened at once. The Botany Bay area had poor soil and little water, and the harbour itself was inferior. Phillip therefore sailed northward on January 21 and entered a superb harbour, <a href=\"/place/Port-Jackson\">Port Jackson</a>, which Cook had marked but not explored. He moved the fleet there; the flag was hoisted on January 26 and the formalities of government begun on February 7. Sydney Cove, the focus of settlement, was deep within Port Jackson, on the southern side; around it was to grow the city of <a href=\"/place/Sydney-New-South-Wales\">Sydney</a>.","Phillip at once established an outstation at <a href=\"/place/Norfolk-Island\">Norfolk Island</a>. Its history was to be checkered; settlement was abandoned in 1813 and revived in 1825 to provide a jail for convicts who misbehaved in Australia. (It served a new purpose from 1856 as a home for the descendants of the mutineers of the HMS <em>Bounty</em>, by then too numerous for <a href=\"/place/Pitcairn-Island\">Pitcairn Island</a>.)","Phillip remained as governor until December 1792, seeing New South Wales through its darkest days.

Farmers and graziers began to fill out an arc 150–200 miles around Sydney; this area was designated as the Nineteen Counties in 1829, and settlement beyond that limit was discouraged.","Following the discovery of Bass Strait, and in order to secure southern waterways, new settlements were established in the south. From Britain, <a href=\"/biography/David-Collins\">David Collins</a> sailed in 1803 to settle <a href=\"/place/Port-Phillip-District\">Port Phillip</a>. His sojourn there was unhappy, and in mid-1804 he moved to the <a href=\"/place/River-Derwent-river-Tasmania-Australia\">River Derwent</a> in southern <a href=\"/place/Tasmania\">Tasmania</a>, already settled (September 1803) by a group from Sydney under <a href=\"/biography/John-Bowen\">John Bowen</a>.

These settlements united in 1812; they were still under supervision from Sydney, although only nominally from 1825. Among penal outstations settled from Sydney were those at <a href=\"/place/Newcastle-New-South-Wales\">Newcastle</a> (1804) and <a href=\"/place/Moreton-Bay\">Moreton Bay</a> (1824), the forerunner of <a href=\"/place/Brisbane\">Brisbane</a>. <a href=\"/place/British-Empire\">Britain</a> extended its possession over the whole of the continent in the 1820s, again fearing French (or even American) intervention. The western boundary of the governor’s commission shifted to 129° in 1825 to include <a href=\"/place/Bathurst-New-South-Wales\">Bathurst</a> and Melville islands in the far north, and there was a small settlement in this region (1824–29). At Western Port, east of Port Phillip, another settlement was made (1826–27), while in January 1827 <a href=\"/biography/Edmund-Lockyer\">Edmund Lockyer</a> began permanent settlement at <a href=\"/place/Albany-Western-Australia\">Albany</a>, Western Australia. His instructions stated that Britain now claimed all Australia.","As remarked above, the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constitutional\">constitutional</a> structure was authoritarian. The governors were all service officers. There were no representative institutions, but Acts introduced in 1823 and 1828 provided for executive and legislative councils, with the major officers of government serving in both and an equal number of private individuals, chosen by nomination, in the latter. More significant at this stage was the articulation of a <a href=\"/topic/judiciary\">judicial system</a>, especially the establishment of supreme courts (New South Wales, 1814; Tasmania, 1824); normal trial by jury did not obtain.","Within this rigid structure, sociopolitical factions developed. Most important in the early years was the assertion of the <a href=\"/topic/New-South-Wales-Corps\">New South Wales Corps</a>, stationed at Sydney from 1791. Some officers of the corps sought power and profit with an avidity that led to clash after clash with the early governors. This culminated in the events of January 26, 1808, when <a href=\"/biography/John-Macarthur\">John Macarthur</a>, a former officer of the corps, led an uprising known as the <a href=\"/event/Rum-Rebellion\">Rum Rebellion</a> that deposed Governor <a href=\"/biography/William-Bligh\">William Bligh</a> (served 1806–08), earlier famous for the <em>Bounty</em> mutiny. In due course the imperial government reacted and recalled the corps; but Governor <a href=\"/biography/Lachlan-Macquarie\">Lachlan Macquarie</a> (served 1810–21) also clashed with the colony’s <a href=\"/topic/Exclusive-Australian-history\">Exclusives</a>—former officers and a handful of wealthy free immigrants. Macquarie associated himself with the <a href=\"/topic/Emancipist\">Emancipist</a> faction, a group that argued in favour of former convicts having a particular claim upon government and the colony’s resources.","Macquarie’s attitude disturbed the imperial government. After an official inquiry (1819–21) by John Thomas Bigge, the government encouraged the migration of men of some standing and wealth to both New South Wales and Tasmania. Such men received substantial grants of land and appeared to be the natural leaders of social and economic development. The Emancipists continued to be strong, however, especially through the leadership of <a href=\"/biography/W-C-Wentworth\">William Charles Wentworth</a> (himself the son of a convict woman), whose newspaper, the <em>Australian</em> (founded 1824), was the spearhead of opposition, especially to Governor Ralph Darling (served 1825–31). In Tasmania factions never formed so clearly, but there, also, the press led <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/criticism\">criticism</a> of the government.","By 1830 about 58,000 <a href=\"/topic/penal-colony\">convicts</a>, including almost 50,000 men, had come to Australia (the rate increasing rapidly after 1815). Many were urban thieves. There were a few political prisoners, while a substantial proportion of the Irish convicts (at least a third of the total) had become offenders through sociopolitical unrest. In Australia the convicts were either employed by the government or “assigned” to private employers. In general, conditions were not especially harsh or repressive, and “tickets of leave” and pardons provided relatively quick routes to freedom. Assignment to the new settlers of the 1820s, however, often had an element of slavery, and many convicts must have suffered grief and despair in their exile. Most convicts committed some further misdeeds, although only about one-tenth were charged with serious offenses. Those found guilty went to secondary penal stations, the (sometimes exaggerated) horror spots of Australian history—<a href=\"/place/Macquarie-Harbour\">Macquarie Harbour</a>, <a href=\"/place/Newcastle-New-South-Wales\">Newcastle</a>, and <a href=\"/place/Moreton-Bay\">Moreton Bay</a> in this period and, later, <a href=\"/place/Norfolk-Island\">Norfolk Island</a> and <a href=\"/place/Port-Arthur-inlet-Tasmania-Australia\">Port Arthur</a>. The convicts gave Australia a <em>Lumpenproletariat</em>; but success stories were common enough, and many convicts led decent lives. There were only a few large-scale protests; the most remarkable was the <a href=\"/event/Castle-Hill-Rising\">Castle Hill Rising</a> among Irish convicts outside Sydney in March 1804. Altogether, the impact of such a large convict population was less grim and ugly than might be expected.","The maintenance of convicts was essentially the economic resource of the colony for many years; this function entailed very considerable expenditure by the British government. Wealth was won by supplying government stores with food and grain or by controlling internal trade—or both. The officers of the New South Wales Corps were skilled in filling these roles, although civil officers, private settlers, former convicts, and even serving convicts all had their own means of doing business, and the amount of petty commercial activity was large. Farming was pursued on a widely ranging scale. <a href=\"/biography/John-Macarthur\">John Macarthur</a> was the most notable of those who early believed that <a href=\"/topic/wool\">wool</a> growing would be a major economic resource; he himself received a substantial land grant in 1805 to pursue this hope, and he persuaded Bigge of its validity. By 1830 these hopes were still some distance from fulfillment: sheep long returned more value from their meat than from their wool, and the breeding of wooled sheep suitable to the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environment\">environment</a> took time. The 1820s saw that process quickening, with relatively greater strength in Tasmania. <a href=\"/topic/sealing-hunting\">Sealing</a> and <a href=\"/topic/whaling\">whaling</a> also proved profitable, although the richest seal fields (especially in Bass Strait) were soon thinned; and not until the 1820s did colonists have the wealth to engage seriously in whaling, although British and Americans early used Australian ports for this purpose. Maritime adventure led early colonists to make contact with Pacific islands, most importantly Tahiti.","The period saw some notable exploration by land. From early days in Sydney settlers sought a way over the mountains, some 50–100 miles west. The task was accomplished in 1813; the young Wentworth led the party. A surveyor, <a href=\"/biography/George-William-Evans\">George William Evans</a>, followed their route to Bathurst (founded 1815) and reported rich pastoral country. <a href=\"/biography/John-Oxley\">John Oxley</a> further mapped the inland plains and rivers, especially the Lachlan and Macquarie, and also explored the southern coasts of the future Queensland (1823), while <a href=\"/biography/Allan-Cunningham-Scottish-poet\">Allan Cunningham</a> was the great pioneer of that state’s hinterland (1827). Meanwhile, in 1824–25, <a href=\"/biography/Hamilton-Hume\">Hamilton Hume</a> and William Hovell went overland southward to the western shore of Port Phillip. <a href=\"/biography/Charles-Sturt\">Charles Sturt</a> in 1828–30 won still greater fame by tracing the Murray-Murrumbidgee-Darling river system down to the Murray’s mouth.","The writings of explorers and pioneers were Australia’s first contributions to literary culture. While catering to the European appetite for natural history, they sometimes achieved literary grace. Pictorial illustrations of the new land, some by convicts, also dated from the earliest years. <a href=\"/biography/David-Collins\">David Collins’s</a> <em>An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales</em> (1798) and <a href=\"/biography/W-C-Wentworth\">Wentworth’s</a> <em>Description of New South Wales</em> (1817) were literate, informed, and impressive. Wentworth showed skill as a versifier, too, especially in his <em>Australasia</em> (1823). Newspapers were founded as early as 1803, and they contributed to cultural as well as political history.

He argued that, if land were sold at a “sufficient” price, its owners would be forced to maximize its value by cultivation, while labourers would have to lend their energies to that task before being able to become landowners themselves.

The act made allowance for further revision of the colonial constitutions, and in 1855–56 this took effect in the four colonies, Tasmania then abandoning the name Van Diemen’s Land. Queensland followed after its separation from New South Wales. All had bicameral legislatures, with ministers responsible to the lower houses, which by 1860, except in Tasmania, were elected on a near-democratic basis (all adult non-Aboriginal men were eligible to vote). In Victoria and South Australia the secret ballot was introduced in 1856 (<em>see</em> <a href=\"/topic/Australian-ballot\">Australian ballot</a>).","While the imperial power thus responded to colonial cries for self-rule, on the way there were some tense moments. Virtually all colonists <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/abhorred\">abhorred</a> paying taxes for imperial purposes, including the costs of maintaining convicts locally; a good many disliked convictism altogether; most disputed the imperial right to dictate land policy; and many, especially in South Australia, disapproved of the imperial government’s directing that aid be given to religious denominations.","From the outset of the period, the imperial government fostered a freer market in land and labour throughout the colonies, not merely in South Australia. Thus, grants of land ceased in 1831, replaced by sale. Attempts to create a pastoral-lease system caused much friction, with colonists generally hostile to any demand for payment. In New South Wales in 1844, new regulations even prompted talk of rebellion.","With regard to labour, colonists agreed with imperial encouragement of free migration, but friction arose over the <a href=\"/topic/penal-colony\">convicts</a>. British opinion in the 1830s became increasingly critical of the assignment of convicts to private employers as smacking of slavery; it was abolished in 1840, and with it transportation of convicts to the mainland virtually ceased, although increased numbers were sent to Tasmania. The end of assignment removed the chief virtue of transportation, from the colonists’ viewpoint, and so contributed to a vigorous movement against its continuation. The British government ended transportation to eastern Australia in 1852. In Western Australia transportation began in 1850, at the colonists’ behest, and continued until 1868.

The act made allowance for further revision of the colonial constitutions, and in 1855–56 this took effect in the four colonies, Tasmania then abandoning the name Van Diemen’s Land. Queensland followed after its separation from New South Wales. All had bicameral legislatures, with ministers responsible to the lower houses, which by 1860, except in Tasmania, were elected on a near-democratic basis (all adult non-Aboriginal men were eligible to vote). In Victoria and South Australia the secret ballot was introduced in 1856 (<em>see</em> <a href=\"/topic/Australian-ballot\">Australian ballot</a>).","While the imperial power thus responded to colonial cries for self-rule, on the way there were some tense moments.

Thus, grants of land ceased in 1831, replaced by sale. Attempts to create a pastoral-lease system caused much friction, with colonists generally hostile to any demand for payment. In New South Wales in 1844, new regulations even prompted talk of rebellion.","With regard to labour, colonists agreed with imperial encouragement of free migration, but friction arose over the <a href=\"/topic/penal-colony\">convicts</a>. British opinion in the 1830s became increasingly critical of the assignment of convicts to private employers as smacking of slavery; it was abolished in 1840, and with it transportation of convicts to the mainland virtually ceased, although increased numbers were sent to Tasmania. The end of assignment removed the chief virtue of transportation, from the colonists’ viewpoint, and so contributed to a vigorous movement against its continuation. The British government ended transportation to eastern Australia in 1852. In Western Australia transportation began in 1850, at the colonists’ behest, and continued until 1868. Altogether some 151,000 convicts were sent to eastern Australia and nearly 10,000 to Western Australia.","In the early 1850s the most dramatic political problem arose from the <a href=\"/event/gold-rush\">gold rushes</a>.

Pastoralism flourished, especially up to the mid-1870s; despite land legislation, this was the heyday of the squatter “aristocracy.” Expansion of sheep and cattle growing into the more distant hinterland continued the heroic-pioneer theme of earlier years. Railway construction aided rural industry and proceeded remarkably quickly, notably in the 1880s: between 1875 and 1891 the mileage rose from 1,600 miles to above 10,000 and reached as far as 500 miles inland.

By then <a href=\"/place/Cobar\">Cobar</a>, in central New South Wales, had proved the most important of many new copper fields. Tin also became significant, Mount Bischoff in Tasmania being the world’s largest lode at its discovery in 1871.

By the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/criteria\">criteria</a> of investment, employment, and relative acceleration, the growth of secondary industry outstripped that of primary industry. Secondary industry multiplied its growth some 10 times over during the period, so that manufacturing and construction accounted for one-fourth of the national product in the 1880s. The population ratio shifted decisively from country to town, establishing an extreme capital-city concentration and eventually placing Melbourne and Sydney among the world’s large cities.

Yet creativity and progress survived, and Australia’s troubles were small compared with those of many contemporary societies.","Drabness was most evident in economic affairs. At the broadest level of generality, the period did little more than continue the themes of the 1860–90 generation. The most important such themes were the increasing <a href=\"/topic/industrialization\">industrialization</a> and improvement of <a href=\"/topic/communication\">communications</a>; railways reached their peak of 27,000 miles in 1941, and meanwhile came the motor boom. In the agricultural sector there was significant expansion of exports, with <a href=\"/plant/wheat\">wheat</a>, <a href=\"/science/fruit-plant-reproductive-body\">fruits</a>, <a href=\"/topic/meat\">meat</a>, and <a href=\"/science/sugar-chemical-compound\">sugar</a> becoming much more important than theretofore. But just as manufactures received increasingly high tariff protection, so the marketing of these goods often depended on subsidy. Hence, the <a href=\"/animal/sheep\">sheep</a>’s back continued to be the nation’s great support in world finance. <a href=\"/science/metal-chemistry\">Metals</a>, gold especially, were important in the early years, but thereafter this resource conspicuously failed to provide the vitality of earlier and later times. The worldwide economic depression of the 1930s affected Australia, especially its primary industries. Otherwise, the overall rate of growth, and probably of living standards, too, scrambled upward—more quickly than average in the years around 1910 and again in the early 1940s.","In national politics, candidates fought for office with increasing vigour and resource, while their administrative performances generally began well but then ebbed. A constant theme was the strengthening of the central government against the states. This complemented the high <a href=\"/topic/degree-education\">degree</a> of <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/homogeneity\">homogeneity</a>, especially in personal and social matters, that extended through Australia’s great physical spread; it was expressed primarily through the Commonwealth’s financial powers—at first especially relating to customs and excise duties but later by direct taxation. From <a href=\"/event/World-War-I\">World War I</a> (1914–18) both levels of government imposed income taxes, but in 1942 the federal <a href=\"/topic/government\">government</a> virtually annexed the field, with the high court’s approval. The establishment of a national capital at <a href=\"/place/Canberra\">Canberra</a>, where Parliament first sat in 1927 after having met in Melbourne since federation, symbolized this situation. The strengthening of the <a href=\"/topic/Commonwealth-association-of-states\">Commonwealth</a> was scarcely a product of popular enthusiasm. Several constitutional referenda upheld the rights of the states, each of which had its own distinct political, cultural, and social characteristics.","The first two <a href=\"/topic/prime-minister\">prime ministers</a> were <a href=\"/biography/Edmund-Barton\">Edmund Barton</a> (1901–03) and <a href=\"/biography/Alfred-Deakin\">Alfred Deakin</a> (1903–04), who had headed the federation movement in <a href=\"/place/New-South-Wales\">New South Wales</a> and <a href=\"/place/Victoria-state-Australia\">Victoria</a>, respectively. They were liberal protectionists. Their ministries established a tariff, an administrative structure, and the <a href=\"/event/White-Australia-Policy\">White Australia</a> <a href=\"/topic/immigration\">immigration</a> policy that excluded Asians. They also established the High Court and initiated legislation for a court of conciliation and arbitration. This carried to the highest point in the world the principles of industrial arbitration and judicial imposition of welfare and <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/justice\">justice</a> through <a href=\"/topic/wage\">wage</a> and working-condition awards.","In 1904 <a href=\"/biography/John-Christian-Watson\">John Christian Watson</a> led the first, brief Labor cabinet, followed by <a href=\"/biography/George-Houston-Reid\">George Houston Reid</a>’s conservative free-trade ministry. Deakin led again (1905–08), and <a href=\"/biography/Andrew-Fisher\">Andrew Fisher</a> was Labor’s second prime minister (1908–09); his ministry was defeated when liberals and <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conservatives\">conservatives</a> “fused” in Deakin’s third term (1909–10). Labor then won its first clear majority at election, which it barely lost in 1913 and regained, still under Fisher, in 1914. These changing <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ideologies\">ideologies</a> did not hinder—perhaps even prompted—ambitious governmental policies. Social services were extended with old-age pensions (1908) and maternity grants (1912); protection rose markedly in a 1908 tariff; the Commonwealth Bank was established; and an army and navy developed.","The new nation was psychologically as well as physically prepared for war. Fear of attack became increasingly directed against <a href=\"/place/Japan\">Japan</a>, prompting pressure on <a href=\"/place/Great-Britain-island-Europe\">Great Britain</a> for a firmer policy in the New Hebrides (since 1886 supervised jointly by Britain and <a href=\"/place/France\">France</a>); this was achieved in 1906–07. Although many Australians criticized Britain when the latter appeared negligent of local interests, the dominant note was profound loyalty to the empire. Colonial troops had fought in both the <a href=\"/place/Sudan\">Sudan</a> and South African (Boer) wars.

The most famous engagement of the <a href=\"/place/Australia\">Australia</a> and <a href=\"/place/New-Zealand\">New Zealand</a> Army Corps (<a href=\"/topic/ANZAC\">ANZAC</a>) was in the <a href=\"/event/Gallipoli-Campaign\">Dardanelles Campaign</a> (1915); the day of the landing at Gallipoli—April 25—became the preeminent day of national reverence.

But the shock of war affected politics much more, especially by giving full scope to the furious energy of <a href=\"/biography/William-Morris-Hughes\">William Morris Hughes</a>, who supplanted Fisher as Labor prime minister in October 1915. Soon afterward he visited Britain. There his ferocity as a war leader won acclaim, and he became convinced that Australia must contribute still more. He advocated military <a href=\"/topic/conscription\">conscription</a>, but many Australians felt that the government should not force men to fight in overseas wars, and the large-scale casualties of the war reinforced this notion. A <a href=\"/topic/referendum\">referendum</a> seeking approval for conscription was defeated in October 1916, and immediately afterward the Labor parliamentary <a href=\"/topic/caucus-politics\">caucus</a> moved no confidence in Hughes’s leadership. He continued as <a href=\"/topic/prime-minister\">prime minister</a> of a “national” government, however, even after losing a second conscription referendum in December 1917. The referenda in particular and war stress in general made these years uniquely turbulent in Australian history. The Labor Party lost other men of great ability along with Hughes. The split solidified a long-standing trend for Roman Catholics to support the party. Hughes’s enemies also included the small but growing number of extremists—most notably the Sydney section of the <a href=\"/topic/Industrial-Workers-of-the-World\">Industrial Workers of the World</a> (IWW)—who opposed the war on doctrinaire grounds."],"sections":[],"isFilled":true},{"level":4,"id":"ref42427","sidebarHeader":"The postwar years","header":"The postwar years","paragraphs":["The aftermath of <a href=\"/topic/war\">war</a> continued, but finally resolved, this turbulence. Some radicals hoped that returning servicemen would force <a href=\"/topic/social-change\">social change</a>, but instead the Returned Sailors’ and Soldiers’ Imperial League of Australia (later called the Returned Services League of Australia) became a bastion of conservative order, some of its supporters ready to use physical force against local people they considered “bolsheviks.” The Labor Party faltered, its members adopting a more radical socialist type of platform in 1921, but with far from uniform <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conviction\">conviction</a>. (In 1918 the name <a href=\"/topic/Australian-Labor-Party\">Australian Labor Party</a> [ALP] was adopted throughout Australia.) When the challenge came to Hughes’s leadership early in 1923, it arose partly from the conservative-business wing of Hughes’s own <a href=\"/topic/Nationalist-Party-Chinese-political-party\">Nationalist Party</a> (its representative, <a href=\"/biography/Stanley-Melbourne-Bruce\">Stanley Melbourne Bruce</a>, becoming prime minister) and partly from the <a href=\"/topic/the-Nationals\">Country Party</a>, which from late 1922 held a crucial number of parliamentary seats. Although led by wealthy landowners, the Country Party won support from many small farmers. It benefited too from its former-soldier image and from widespread country-versus-city feeling. Its leader, <a href=\"/biography/Earle-Christmas-Grafton-Page\">Earle C.G. Page</a>, had considerable, if erratic, force.","Bruce continued as prime minister until 1929, with Page his deputy in Nationalist-Country <a href=\"/topic/coalition\">coalitions</a>. Bruce strove to buoy the economy by attracting British investment and fostering corporative <a href=\"/topic/capitalism\">capitalism</a>. Tariffs, bounties, prices, and public indebtedness all rose. There was considerable administrative innovation—e.g., the Loan Council regulated all <a href=\"/topic/government\">government</a> borrowing—and the successful Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (later called the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation [CSIRO]) was established in 1926 to apply scientific expertise to developmental problems. The worldwide development of consumer industry had its impact: the revolution in <a href=\"/technology/transportation-technology\">transportation</a> provided by the automobile is the best example, although full-scale car production was still in the future.","With much economic activity subsidized—the exception being one primary product, wool—Australia was particularly <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vulnerable\">vulnerable</a> to the <a href=\"/event/Great-Depression\">Great Depression</a> of the 1930s. It struck hard: unemployment exceeded one-fourth of the <a href=\"/science/labor-childbirth\">work force</a> and imposed a degree of social misery rarely known in Australian history. The rate of recovery was uneven, manufactures doing better than primary industry. <a href=\"/science/population-biology-and-anthropology\">Population</a> growth slowed; at the nadir, emigration exceeded immigration.","Politics reflected the impact. <a href=\"/biography/James-Henry-Scullin\">James Henry Scullin</a> succeeded Bruce as <a href=\"/topic/prime-minister\">prime minister</a> in October 1929, but his Labor ministry suffered the real squeeze of events; within the ALP there was considerable division as to how government should react to the Depression. Some favoured a generally inflationist policy, with banks <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/facilitating\">facilitating</a> credit issue and governments extending <a href=\"/technology/public-utility\">public works</a>. Right-wing Labor distrusted such a policy; <a href=\"/topic/radical-ideologist\">radicals</a> would have gone further by renouncing interest payment on overseas loans. Conservative opinion argued for deflationary policies—curtailed government expenditure, lower wages, balancing the budget, and the honouring of interest commitments. In June 1931 the <a href=\"/topic/Commonwealth-association-of-states\">Commonwealth</a> and the state governments agreed on a plan, called the Premiers’ Plan. Although the plan had some inflationary features, it foreshadowed a one-fifth reduction in government spending, including <a href=\"/topic/wage\">wages</a> and <a href=\"/topic/pension\">pensions</a>—a considerable affront to Labor’s traditional attitudes.","Against this background the government disintegrated. Before the Premiers’ Plan, some Labor right-wingers, led by <a href=\"/biography/Joseph-Aloysius-Lyons\">Joseph Aloysius Lyons</a>, had crossed to the opposition. In November some leftist dissidents voted against Scullin, forcing his resignation. In the elections that followed, Labor suffered a heavy defeat. The new prime minister was Lyons, whose followers had coalesced with the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/erstwhile\">erstwhile</a> Nationalists to form the <a href=\"/topic/United-Australia-Party\">United Australia Party</a> (UAP). Lyons led a wholly UAP government until 1934 and UAP-Country coalitions until his death in 1939.","The Lyons governments provided stability and not much more. Recovery was uneven and sporadic, quicker in manufacturing than in primary industry, aided more by market forces than by governmental planning. Two policies failed to fulfill expectations—the Imperial Economic Conference, held at Ottawa, Ontario, <a href=\"/place/Canada\">Canada</a>, in 1932, improved trade slightly, but the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integrated\">integrated</a> economic <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community\">community</a> for which some had hoped never developed. Australia’s trade diversion policy of 1936, which tried to redress the imbalance of imports from <a href=\"/place/Japan\">Japan</a> and the United States, offended those countries and actually reduced exports further. A plan for national <a href=\"/topic/insurance\">insurance</a>, the Lyons governments’ most ambitious social legislation, also aborted. These mishaps did not much bother the electorate; improvement, even if meagre, was enough to retain favour.","Internal division was the greater threat to the government. This became <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manifest\">manifest</a> after Lyons’s death. The UAP elected <a href=\"/biography/Robert-Menzies\">Robert Gordon Menzies</a> its new leader (and therefore prime minister); but the decision was hard fought, and it was criticized publicly and vehemently by Page, still leader of the Country Party. Nevertheless, Menzies retained office; but internal division persisted, the <a href=\"/topic/coalition\">coalition</a>’s parliamentary majority was tiny, and Menzies resigned in August 1941. Arthur William Fadden, the new leader of the Country Party, then took office, but in October he gave way to <a href=\"/biography/John-Curtin\">John Curtin</a> and a Labor ministry.","While the electorate generally voted conservative, Australia shared the common Western experience of the interwar years in the rise of a small, vigorous communist movement. Founded in 1922, the Australian Communist Party made most headway in the big industrial unions and in Sydney; it also had some influence and supporters among the intelligentsia, especially in the 1930s. The party suffered a share of internal factionalism but for the most part was able to present a united face to the public.","<a href=\"/topic/fascism\">Fascism</a> achieved no formal political recognition in Australia, but there were hints of sympathy toward fascist attitudes—<a href=\"/biography/D-H-Lawrence\">D.H. Lawrence</a> wrote of such in his novel <em>Kangaroo</em>, based on a brief visit in 1922; and an “Australia First” movement began in literary <a href=\"/topic/nationalism\">nationalism</a> but drifted into race mystique and perhaps even <a href=\"/topic/treason\">treason</a>. An <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intellectual\">intellectual</a> movement of more lasting force developed among a group of young Roman Catholic <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intellectuals\">intellectuals</a> in <a href=\"/place/Melbourne-Queensland\">Melbourne</a> in the mid-1930s. They developed a commitment to social justice and against <a href=\"/topic/communism\">communism</a>, somewhat in the manner of <a href=\"/biography/G-K-Chesterton\">G.K. Chesterton</a>. This was known as the <a href=\"/topic/Catholic-Social-Movement\">Catholic Social Movement</a>, and it had considerable influence.","Whereas Australia had been virtually spoiling for war before 1914, passivity became the international keynote after 1920. At the <a href=\"/event/Paris-Peace-Conference\">Paris Peace Conference</a> that formally concluded <a href=\"/event/World-War-I\">World War I</a>, Hughes was his fire-eating self, especially in defense of Australia’s interests in the Pacific. Thus he won a <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mandate\">mandate</a> for erstwhile German <a href=\"/place/New-Guinea\">New Guinea</a> and <a href=\"/place/Nauru\">Nauru</a> (an atoll in the central Pacific) and effectually opposed a Japanese motion proclaiming racial <a href=\"/topic/equality-human-rights\">equality</a>, which he thought might presage an attack on Australia’s <a href=\"/topic/immigration\">immigration</a> laws. In the <a href=\"/topic/League-of-Nations\">League of Nations</a>, Australia was an independent member from the outset. Yet in following years “the empire” became the object of even more <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rhetoric\">rhetoric</a> and more desperate hope than earlier. Australia did not ratify the <a href=\"/event/Statute-of-Westminster\">Statute of Westminster</a> (1931, embodying the 1926 <a href=\"/topic/Balfour-Report\">Balfour Report</a> as to the constitutional equality of the dominions) until 1942. The UAP <a href=\"/topic/government\">governments</a> followed Britain closely in its attitude toward the totalitarian expansion of the 1930s; if Australian influence counted for anything, it was to strengthen <a href=\"/topic/appeasement-foreign-policy\">appeasement</a> of <a href=\"/place/Germany\">Germany</a> and <a href=\"/place/Japan\">Japan</a>. Although fear of Japan continued, that country’s accession to the fascist camp did not provoke a tougher governmental line. The government suspected that Britain could not control the <a href=\"/place/Eastern-Hemisphere\">Eastern Hemisphere</a> but found no answer to that dire problem. The Labor Party meanwhile was even more incoherent and variable in matters of <a href=\"/topic/foreign-policy\">foreign policy</a> than were its social democratic counterparts elsewhere in the Western world: <a href=\"/topic/isolationism-foreign-policy\">isolationism</a> and antifascism were equal and opposing forces."],"sections":[],"isFilled":true},{"level":4,"id":"ref42428","sidebarHeader":"World War II","header":"World War II","paragraphs":["When <a href=\"/topic/war\">war</a> came again, however, the nation’s response was firm—some 30,000 Australians died in <a href=\"/event/World-War-II\">World War II</a> (1938–45), and 65,000 were injured. From early in the war, the Royal Australian Air Force was active in the defense of Britain. The Australian Navy operated in the <a href=\"/place/Mediterranean-Sea\">Mediterranean Sea</a> (1940–41), helping to win the Battle of Cape Matapan (March 1941). Australian troops fought in the seesaw battles of <a href=\"/place/North-Africa\">North Africa</a>.","In mid-1941 Australians suffered heavy losses both in the Allied defeats in <a href=\"/place/Greece\">Greece</a> and <a href=\"/place/Crete\">Crete</a> and in the victories in the <a href=\"/place/Levant\">Levant</a>. Meanwhile, the German general <a href=\"/biography/Erwin-Rommel\">Erwin Rommel</a> was scoring his greatest triumphs in North Africa. Out of these emerged the successful Allied defense of <a href=\"/place/Tobruk\">Tobruk</a>, carried out substantially by Australians (April–December 1941), and the decisive victory at the battles of <a href=\"/place/El-Alamein\">El-Alamein</a>, in which an Australian division played a key role.","After the <a href=\"/topic/history-of-Japan\">Japanese</a> attacked the U.S. naval base at <a href=\"/topic/Pearl-Harbor\">Pearl Harbor</a>, <a href=\"/place/Hawaii-state\">Hawaii</a> (December 7, 1941), however, the focus shifted homeward. The Japanese victories of the following months more than fulfilled the fantasies that fear and hate had long prompted in Australia. On February 15, 1942, 15,000 Australians became prisoners of war when <a href=\"/place/Singapore\">Singapore</a> fell to Japanese forces, and four days later war came to the nation’s shores when <a href=\"/place/Darwin-Northern-Territory\">Darwin</a> was bombed. Then came a Japanese swing southward that by August threatened to overrun <a href=\"/place/Port-Moresby\">Port Moresby</a>, <a href=\"/place/New-Guinea\">New Guinea</a>.","When Australia entered the war, compulsory military training was reintroduced by the Menzies government and commenced in January 1940. All unmarried men age 21  were required to complete three months of compulsory military training in the Citizen Military Forces (also known as the Militia). Because the Defence Act of 1903 restricted conscription to soldiers fighting on Australian land, a separate volunteer force, the 2nd Australian Imperial Force, was established to send troops to fight abroad while the Citizens Military Force defended the homeland and its territories.","In 1942 the worsening situation in the Pacific and in Southeast Asia, along with the consequent threat of a Japanese land invasion in northern Australia, caused widespread panic in Australia and led the government to take drastic measures to protect the country and its territories. John Curtin, leader of the Australian Labor Party, who had succeeded Menzies as prime minister, reversed his strong personal opposition to compulsory overseas military service to allow the government to conscript soldiers to fight the Japanese in the “South-West Pacific Area.” Enacted on February 19, 1943, the Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Act of 1943 extended the defense of Australia to include the territory of New Guinea and adjacent islands, thus allowing for the conscription of Australian troops to serve in the “South-Western Pacific Zone.”","The <a href=\"/place/United-States\">United States</a> became Australia’s major ally. In a famous statement (December 1941), Prime Minister Curtin declared: “I make it quite clear that Australia looks to America, free from any pangs about our traditional links of friendship to Britain.” A sharper note of independence from Britain came when Curtin insisted (February 1942) that Australian troops recalled from the <a href=\"/place/Middle-East\">Middle East</a> should return to Australia itself and not help in the defense of Burma (<a href=\"/place/Myanmar\">Myanmar</a>) as British Prime Minister <a href=\"/biography/Winston-Churchill\">Winston Churchill</a> wished. Conversely, American needs prompted total response to Curtin’s call. U.S. Gen. <a href=\"/biography/Douglas-MacArthur\">Douglas MacArthur</a>, commander in chief of the South-West Pacific Area, established his headquarters first in <a href=\"/place/Melbourne-Queensland\">Melbourne</a> and then in <a href=\"/plant/Brisbane-box\">Brisbane</a>.","The large U.S. military presence in Brisbane was not without problems. When American troops began arriving in Australia in December 1941, their presence was warmly welcomed. However, Australian attitudes toward them began to change, particularly the attitude of Australian soldiers who felt threatened by the attention Australian women showed toward the better-paid, more stylishly uniformed American soldiers. The increasing tension erupted into the “<a href=\"/event/Battle-of-Brisbane\">Battle of Brisbane</a>,” two nights of large-scale rioting that took place between Australians and U.S. servicemen in Brisbane’s central business district on November 26–27, 1942. One Australian died and hundreds were wounded on both sides as a result of the violent clash.","Brisbane also figured large in an <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alleged\">alleged</a> defense strategy that ultimately proved to be a canard, according to which, in the event of a Japanese invasion, the northern parts of the continent beyond “the Brisbane Line” between Brisbane and Perth were to have been conceded to the enemy without resistance. Supposedly, the objective of this plan was to concentrate Australian armed forces between Brisbane and Melbourne, where most of the crucial industrial regions were located. The idea was that the sheer distance that would have to be traveled by Japanese forces to reach the Brisbane Line would be debilitating for them.","During an election campaign in October 1942, Labor minister Edward Ward accused the previous Menzies and Fadden governments of having planned this strategy, though he had no evidence to support his claims. MacArthur’s mention of the “Brisbane Line” to reporters in March 1943 sparked further public concern and controversy. A Royal Commission  that operated from June to September 1943, however, determined that no such plan had ever existed as an official policy. Indeed, MacArthur decided that the best way to stop Japanese forces from advancing to Australia was to make a stand in New Guinea.","Meanwhile, on land, the fortunes of <a href=\"/topic/war\">war</a> turned against the Japanese in August–September 1942, beginning with an Allied (primarily Australian) victory at <a href=\"/place/Milne-Bay\">Milne Bay</a>, New Guinea. More prolonged—and of more heroic dimension in Australian eyes—was the forcing back of the Japanese from southern New Guinea over the Kokoda Track (or Trail), along which Australian soldiers put up strong resistance against seemingly overwhelming odds. The Japanese, having failed to capture <a href=\"/place/Port-Moresby\">Port Moresby</a> by sea in the <a href=\"/event/Battle-of-the-Coral-Sea\">Battle of the Coral Sea</a> (May 4–8, 1942), landed in northern New Guinea at the beachheads of Gona and Buna on July 21, 1942, with the intention of taking the New Guinea capital by pushing south over the rugged <a href=\"/place/Owen-Stanley-Range\">Owen Stanley Range</a> along the Kokoda Track. In a series of engagements during what proved to be a four-month campaign, Australian troops eventually forced their more powerful adversary to withdraw, retaking the Kokoda region on November 2, 1942. Their actions arguably saved Australia from Japanese invasion and, as such, formed a defining moment in Australian history. The endurance, courage, “mateship,” and never-give-up attitude the Australian soldiers displayed during the campaign fostered the so-called ANZAC <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legend\">legend</a>, the tradition of the indomitable spirit of Australian troops that began with the original<a href=\"/topic/ANZAC\"> ANZAC</a>s in the <a href=\"/event/Gallipoli-Campaign\">Gallipoli Campaign</a> of 1915 and continues today as an important element of national identity.","A long <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attrition\">attrition</a> of Japanese forces elsewhere in New Guinea and the islands followed the <a href=\"/event/Kokoda-Track-Campaign\">Kokoda Track Campaign</a>, with Australia initially playing a major role and subsequently playing a role secondary to American forces. Both Australian volunteers and conscripts fought in these campaigns, the government and people having accepted the legitimacy of sending conscripts as far north as the <a href=\"/place/Equator\">Equator</a> and as far west and east as the 110th and 159th <a href=\"/science/meridian-geography\">meridians</a>.","Because defeat in the Battles of the Coral Sea and <a href=\"/event/Battle-of-Midway\">Midway</a> prevented Japan from continuing to supply its forces in Burma (<a href=\"/place/Myanmar\">Myanmar</a>) by sea, the Japanese high command undertook the building of a rail line between <a href=\"/place/Thailand\">Thailand</a> and Burma. In addition to Asian labourers, more than 60,000 Allied <a href=\"/topic/prisoner-of-war\">prisoners of war</a> (POWs), including about 13,000 Australians, were forced to construct the 260-mile (415-km) Burma (Thai-Burma) Railway Line. Subject to cruel punishment and torture, the POWs also suffered from disease and malnutrition. As a result, more than one-fifth of them, including more than 2,800 Australians, died during the yearlong (October 1942–October 1943) construction of the railway. The will to survive exhibited by the Australian POWs—including Lieut. Col. <a href=\"/biography/Weary-Dunlop\">Ernest Edward (“Weary”) Dunlop</a>, an army surgeon who risked his life by standing up to his Japanese captors to protect the men in his care—contributed further to the ANZAC legend.","There were more than two dozen POW camps in Australia. On August 5, 1944, one of the largest POW breakouts in history occurred at the facility in <a href=\"/place/Cowra\">Cowra</a> in east-central New South Wales.

The arrival and presence of over 100,000  U.S. troops in Australia from 1941 had a substantial impact on postwar culture and society. The American alliance with Australia during the war forged close ties between the two countries, and Australia came to depend on the United States for military support as well as economic growth. Prior to the war, Australian society had been largely influenced by conservative British culture, mirroring its entertainment, music, and sports as well as its social attitudes. By the end of the war a significant change was underway, however, and from the 1950s onward Australian lifestyles felt the dramatic impact of the new more rebellious culture of the United States, which had emerged from the war in a powerful economic position.","The strong cultural influence that the United States exerted over other Western countries, especially Australia, was profound. Because Australia also experienced an economic boom as a result of the war, its newfound affluent position enabled Australians to embrace innovative new and now more-affordable products and technologies, many of which were imported from the more industrialized United States. American ideals and cultural products, such as film and music, quickly dispersed throughout Australian society, with an accompanying move away from the traditional restricted ways of prewar life to a more liberated and expressive lifestyle.","Film-going had become one of the most popular pastimes for Australian people during World War II, as motion pictures provided a form of escapism from the horrors of the real wartime world. In 1945 alone, 151 million cinema admissions were recorded in Australia. Most of the films shown on Australian screens between the 1940s and ’50s, however, were produced by American companies. Australian-made films were in very short supply in the early 1950s. Many of the American films appealed to a teenage audience with their depiction of radical American social themes and ideals. This exposure undoubtedly had an impact upon impressionable adolescents, sparking the birth of a new youth culture in Australia.","The introduction of <a href=\"/topic/television-broadcasting\">television</a> in Australia in September 1956 provided a new cultural experience and resulted in a dramatic decline in cinema attendance. Television quickly became one of the most popular forms of entertainment and one of the most influential mediums in the country. The Australian government had been determined to have the country’s first television network up and running in time for the Melbourne Olympic Games, and it met this objective with some two months to spare.","In the initial years after television’s arrival, not many Australians could afford the new technology.  However, as televisions became less expensive, the number of Australians who owned a television rapidly increased. Despite the enormous popularity of television, a small proportion of society opposed it, mainly because the majority of programs were American productions. With more than 80 percent of television content sourced from the United States, it was feared that American content, themes, and culture would impede the development of the Australian identity. This concern was <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alleviated\">alleviated</a> somewhat when the demand for an increase in Australian content led to the broadcasting of more Australian programs in the mid-1960s, particularly Australian dramatic series.","The proliferation of vinyl records after World War II had a major impact on the experience of music in Australia and revolutionized the music industry. By the early 1960s more than 500,000 records were being manufactured every month in Australia. This spike in record production coincided with the explosion of rebellious youth-oriented culture, sparked by the rise of <a href=\"/art/rock-and-roll-early-style-of-rock-music\">rock and roll</a>, the arrival of which in Australia is usually dated to the theatrical release in 1955 of <a href=\"/topic/Blackboard-Jungle\"></a>; the movie featured the hit single “Rock Around the Clock” by the American band <a href=\"/biography/Bill-Haley\">Bill Haley</a> and <a href=\"/topic/Bill-Haley-and-His-Comets\">His Comets</a>, whose Australian tour in 1957 was a sensation.

With the exciting new music came the creation of expressive new dance styles and trendy youthful clothing. Put off by the accompanying changes in behaviour, fashion, and attitudes, some in the older generation blamed rock and roll for the rise in <a href=\"/topic/delinquency\">juvenile delinquency</a>. But new music had come to stay, and in the successive decades many Australians would put their mark on the development of <a href=\"/art/rock-music\">rock music</a>.","The postwar era of the 1950s was also a time of prosperity and major achievement for Australian sports.

Yet in 1946 the ALP government initiated a policy that assisted the entry not only of people from the United Kingdom but also of many others from war-distressed <a href=\"/place/Europe\">Europe</a>. The peak year of net immigration (about 150,000) was 1950, while the greatest numbers of assisted migrants (about 100,000 per annum) came in the later 1960s.

The estimated number of persons of Aboriginal descent had risen from a nadir of 73,828 in 1933 to more than 170,000 in the early 1980s; in 1962, Aboriginal people received the franchise and, for the first time, were to be counted in the national census. Aboriginal claims moved from wage equality with Europeans to land rights over territory with Aboriginal associations. The South Australian government acted in this direction from 1966, and the federal Aboriginal Land Rights Act (1976), applying to the Northern Territory, was particularly important. In 1967 the general electorate overwhelmingly supported a constitutional <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amendment\">amendment</a> to increase Commonwealth powers in Aboriginal matters. Equality in formal civic rights, wage payments, and social welfare benefits became the norm. Some groups received considerable royalties from mining activities on their land.","The Whitlam government in particular encouraged a variety of ethnic organizations, most importantly the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee (founded in 1973, from 1977 renamed the National Aboriginal Conference). These organizations contributed to a growing strength and pride in Aboriginality. Early in the period, Aboriginal persons became known for their contributions to sport (boxer <a href=\"/biography/Lionel-Rose\">Lionel Rose</a>, tennis player <a href=\"/biography/Evonne-Goolagong-Cawley\">Evonne Goolagong Cawley</a>).

School curricula began to provide sympathetic teaching of Aboriginal culture to all Australians. Such policies reinforced a shift away from assimilationist ideas. This shift applied nationwide but had particular relevance in sustaining the surviving remnants of tribal life. In the late 20th century the number of Aboriginal persons with some experience of traditional Aboriginal life was estimated to be about 10,000.","Increased awareness of past depredations against Aboriginal peoples helped shape a wider-ranging <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/critique\">critique</a> of the Australian experience. Dissidents influenced by the New Marxism of the later 1960s (notably Humphrey McQueen in his <em>A New Britannia</em>, first published in 1970) saw the nation as ever dominated by petty bourgeois standards—mean, acquisitive, racist, and authoritarian. Many earlier commentators had perceived such traits, but now they were attacked with more fundamental repugnance. The dismissal of Whitlam in 1975 encouraged the belief that essentially Australia was not a democracy and that it suffered much from a heritage of subservience to <a href=\"/place/British-Empire\">British</a> imperial standards. While this radical critique lost some acerbity after 1980, it left an impression, especially on the liberal intelligentsia. One result was greater emphasis on the dignity and autonomy of Australian-centred <a href=\"/topic/cultural-studies\">cultural studies</a>. <a href=\"/biography/Robert-Hughes\">Robert Hughes’s</a> <em>The Fatal Shore: The Epic of Australia’s Founding</em> (1987), a vivid account of the experiences of both transported convicts and colonists that became an international <a href=\"/topic/best-seller\">best seller</a>, explored Australia’s origins as a colony and its search for a national identity.","<a href=\"/science/conservation-ecology\">Environmental activism</a> developed, often spurred by repugnance to the exploitative development that radicals saw, with much truth, as central to Australian history since 1788. Some aspects of <a href=\"/topic/environmentalism\">environmentalism</a> gained support across a wide spectrum. Most state governments introduced controls about 1970. There was a particularly emotional campaign to save beautiful Lake Pedder in <a href=\"/place/Tasmania\">Tasmania</a> from conversion into a hydroelectric dam. The campaign failed in 1973, but in that year the federal government established an inquiry into the national estate, from which resulted the Australian Heritage Commission Act in 1975. In 1982 the High Court agreed that the Commonwealth had power to override states on environmental matters should the issue in question come within the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/purview\">purview</a> of an international <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/covenant\">covenant</a> to which Australia was a party. Environmentalists have exercised considerable influence as pressure groups and have made some essays into parliamentary politics: in 1989 a “Green” group acquired the <a href=\"/topic/balance-of-power\">balance of power</a> in <a href=\"/place/Tasmania\">Tasmania</a>, aided by the system of proportional representation prevailing there. While Australia contributed only a little to the mainstream of environmental theory, <a href=\"/biography/Peter-Singer\">Peter Singer</a> of Monash University won international renown for his exposition of <a href=\"/topic/animal-rights\">animal rights</a>.","Miriam Dixson in <em>The Real Matilda</em> (1976) argued that Australian <a href=\"/topic/women\">women</a> had suffered an inferior status, markedly below that of women in Western society at large. Her case was arguable, but the increasing volume of feminist studies more often stressed the achievements of women, though often against great odds, in many sectors of society and culture. Feminists played an important part in the expansion of Australian studies; women increased their share in Australian literary work, often writing on feminist themes. <a href=\"/biography/Germaine-Greer\">Germaine Greer</a>, born in Melbourne, achieved eminence for her writings.","The number of women physicians and lawyers in Australia rose significantly, but more sizable still was the impact of women in the public service. Some succeeded in federal politics, and a greater number at the state level: in 1990 Carmen Lawrence (in <a href=\"/place/Western-Australia\">Western Australia</a>) and Joan Kirner (in <a href=\"/place/Victoria-state-Australia\">Victoria</a>) were the first women to become leaders of governments.","<a href=\"/topic/gay-rights-movement\">Gay</a> and <a href=\"/topic/lesbian-feminism\">lesbian</a> activism followed much the same path in Australia as elsewhere; Sydney was said to have become one of the major “gay” cities of the world.

It confirmed that Australia was already occupied in a manner recognizable under British law when the first white settlers arrived.

The resulting <a href=\"/topic/Native-Title-Act\">Native Title Act</a> (1993) was unsuccessfully challenged, and subsequently, under its judgment in 1996 (the Wik case), the High Court decided that Indigenous title and pastoral leasehold could coexist. Aboriginal descent became a matter of pride, and by the early 21st century the number affirming themselves to be Aboriginal was some half million.","Meanwhile, despite such advances, the bleakness of much Aboriginal experience remained stark and disturbing—illness, alcoholism, and violence all having their part. The many deaths of Aboriginal men while in official custody added to such feeling, and still more so invocation of the long history of Aboriginal families being forcibly separated. While all governments upheld the desirability of racial reconciliation, they remained reluctant to make a formal apology for past wrongs.","Debate as to constitutional change quickened in the late 1990s, many seeing the time as opportune for a shift to republican status. However, when the matter came to <a href=\"/topic/referendum\">referendum</a> vote in 1999, republicans divided over how radical their intended change should be. With many other Australians still attached to traditional and even monarchical <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sentiment\">sentiment</a>, the referendum failed decisively.","Following four consecutive electoral wins, John Howard and the Liberal-National <a href=\"/topic/coalition\">coalition</a> were swept from power with the November 2007 election victory of <a href=\"/biography/Kevin-Rudd\">Kevin Rudd</a> and the Labor Party. Under Rudd, Labor advocated <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proactive\">proactive</a> domestic policies to preserve the environment, to improve <a href=\"/topic/education\">education</a>, public <a href=\"/science/hospital\">hospitals</a>, and the country’s <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/infrastructure\">infrastructure</a>, and to establish a fair and flexible work environment for all Australians. Rudd also favoured a plan to extricate Australian soldiers from Iraq, where they had been assisting in the U.S.-led war effort. In a historic address on February 13, 2008, Rudd issued a formal apology to <a href=\"/topic/Australian-Aboriginal\">Aboriginal</a> peoples for abuses they had suffered under early Australian administrations.","In 2009 the linchpin of Rudd’s environmental <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/initiative\">initiative</a>, the <a href=\"/technology/emissions-trading\">Emissions Trading</a> Scheme, failed to gain passage, and, when he withdrew the legislation in 2010, his action was criticized in some quarters as timid. Rudd’s hold on power was further threatened by strident opposition from business groups to the controversial Resource Super Profits Tax, a proposal targeted at the mining industry and scheduled to go into effect in 2012. Support for Rudd within the Labor Party waned so much that he did not even contest a leadership vote in June 2010 in which <a href=\"/biography/Julia-Gillard\">Julia Gillard</a> replaced him as party leader. She became Australia’s first woman prime minister.","Shortly after taking office, Gillard called for a new election, which took place in late August (<em>see</em> <a href=\"/topic/2010-1701953\">Australian federal election of 2010</a>). The results were extremely close, and neither Labor nor the Liberals won an outright majority in the House of Representatives.

The popularity of both Gillard and her party declined in the following years. In June 2013 Gillard called for a leadership vote in the Labor Party, and she was defeated by Rudd.

While basic <a href=\"/topic/immigration\">immigration</a> patterns continued, greater scrutiny and selectivity prevailed, especially of those seeking <a href=\"/topic/refugee\">refugee</a> status.

When the challenge came to Hughes’s leadership early in 1923, it arose partly from the conservative-business wing of Hughes’s own <a href=\"/topic/Nationalist-Party-Chinese-political-party\">Nationalist Party</a> (its representative, <a href=\"/biography/Stanley-Melbourne-Bruce\">Stanley Melbourne Bruce</a>, becoming prime minister) and partly from the <a href=\"/topic/the-Nationals\">Country Party</a>, which from late 1922 held a crucial number of parliamentary seats. Although led by wealthy landowners, the Country Party won support from many small farmers. It benefited too from its former-soldier image and from widespread country-versus-city feeling. Its leader, <a href=\"/biography/Earle-Christmas-Grafton-Page\">Earle C.G. Page</a>, had considerable, if erratic, force.","Bruce continued as prime minister until 1929, with Page his deputy in Nationalist-Country <a href=\"/topic/coalition\">coalitions</a>. Bruce strove to buoy the economy by attracting British investment and fostering corporative <a href=\"/topic/capitalism\">capitalism</a>. Tariffs, bounties, prices, and public indebtedness all rose. There was considerable administrative innovation—e.g., the Loan Council regulated all <a href=\"/topic/government\">government</a> borrowing—and the successful Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (later called the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation [CSIRO]) was established in 1926 to apply scientific expertise to developmental problems. The worldwide development of consumer industry had its impact: the revolution in <a href=\"/technology/transportation-technology\">transportation</a> provided by the automobile is the best example, although full-scale car production was still in the future.","With much economic activity subsidized—the exception being one primary product, wool—Australia was particularly <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vulnerable\">vulnerable</a> to the <a href=\"/event/Great-Depression\">Great Depression</a> of the 1930s. It struck hard: unemployment exceeded one-fourth of the <a href=\"/science/labor-childbirth\">work force</a> and imposed a degree of social misery rarely known in Australian history. The rate of recovery was uneven, manufactures doing better than primary industry. <a href=\"/science/population-biology-and-anthropology\">Population</a> growth slowed; at the nadir, emigration exceeded immigration.","Politics reflected the impact. <a href=\"/biography/James-Henry-Scullin\">James Henry Scullin</a> succeeded Bruce as <a href=\"/topic/prime-minister\">prime minister</a> in October 1929, but his Labor ministry suffered the real squeeze of events; within the ALP there was considerable division as to how government should react to the Depression. Some favoured a generally inflationist policy, with banks <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/facilitating\">facilitating</a> credit issue and governments extending <a href=\"/technology/public-utility\">public works</a>. Right-wing Labor distrusted such a policy; <a href=\"/topic/radical-ideologist\">radicals</a> would have gone further by renouncing interest payment on overseas loans. Conservative opinion argued for deflationary policies—curtailed government expenditure, lower wages, balancing the budget, and the honouring of interest commitments. In June 1931 the <a href=\"/topic/Commonwealth-association-of-states\">Commonwealth</a> and the state governments agreed on a plan, called the Premiers’ Plan. Although the plan had some inflationary features, it foreshadowed a one-fifth reduction in government spending, including <a href=\"/topic/wage\">wages</a> and <a href=\"/topic/pension\">pensions</a>—a considerable affront to Labor’s traditional attitudes.","Against this background the government disintegrated. Before the Premiers’ Plan, some Labor right-wingers, led by <a href=\"/biography/Joseph-Aloysius-Lyons\">Joseph Aloysius Lyons</a>, had crossed to the opposition. In November some leftist dissidents voted against Scullin, forcing his resignation. In the elections that followed, Labor suffered a heavy defeat. The new prime minister was Lyons, whose followers had coalesced with the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/erstwhile\">erstwhile</a> Nationalists to form the <a href=\"/topic/United-Australia-Party\">United Australia Party</a> (UAP). Lyons led a wholly UAP government until 1934 and UAP-Country coalitions until his death in 1939.","The Lyons governments provided stability and not much more. Recovery was uneven and sporadic, quicker in manufacturing than in primary industry, aided more by market forces than by governmental planning. Two policies failed to fulfill expectations—the Imperial Economic Conference, held at Ottawa, Ontario, <a href=\"/place/Canada\">Canada</a>, in 1932, improved trade slightly, but the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integrated\">integrated</a> economic <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community\">community</a> for which some had hoped never developed. Australia’s trade diversion policy of 1936, which tried to redress the imbalance of imports from <a href=\"/place/Japan\">Japan</a> and the United States, offended those countries and actually reduced exports further. A plan for national <a href=\"/topic/insurance\">insurance</a>, the Lyons governments’ most ambitious social legislation, also aborted. These mishaps did not much bother the electorate; improvement, even if meagre, was enough to retain favour.","Internal division was the greater threat to the government. This became <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manifest\">manifest</a> after Lyons’s death. The UAP elected <a href=\"/biography/Robert-Menzies\">Robert Gordon Menzies</a> its new leader (and therefore prime minister); but the decision was hard fought, and it was criticized publicly and vehemently by Page, still leader of the Country Party. Nevertheless, Menzies retained office; but internal division persisted, the <a href=\"/topic/coalition\">coalition</a>’s parliamentary majority was tiny, and Menzies resigned in August 1941. Arthur William Fadden, the new leader of the Country Party, then took office, but in October he gave way to <a href=\"/biography/John-Curtin\">John Curtin</a> and a Labor ministry.","While the electorate generally voted conservative, Australia shared the common Western experience of the interwar years in the rise of a small, vigorous communist movement. Founded in 1922, the Australian Communist Party made most headway in the big industrial unions and in Sydney; it also had some influence and supporters among the intelligentsia, especially in the 1930s. The party suffered a share of internal factionalism but for the most part was able to present a united face to the public.","<a href=\"/topic/fascism\">Fascism</a> achieved no formal political recognition in Australia, but there were hints of sympathy toward fascist attitudes—<a href=\"/biography/D-H-Lawrence\">D.H. Lawrence</a> wrote of such in his novel <em>Kangaroo</em>, based on a brief visit in 1922; and an “Australia First” movement began in literary <a href=\"/topic/nationalism\">nationalism</a> but drifted into race mystique and perhaps even <a href=\"/topic/treason\">treason</a>. An <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intellectual\">intellectual</a> movement of more lasting force developed among a group of young Roman Catholic <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intellectuals\">intellectuals</a> in <a href=\"/place/Melbourne-Queensland\">Melbourne</a> in the mid-1930s. They developed a commitment to social justice and against <a href=\"/topic/communism\">communism</a>, somewhat in the manner of <a href=\"/biography/G-K-Chesterton\">G.K. Chesterton</a>. This was known as the <a href=\"/topic/Catholic-Social-Movement\">Catholic Social Movement</a>, and it had considerable influence.","Whereas Australia had been virtually spoiling for war before 1914, passivity became the international keynote after 1920. At the <a href=\"/event/Paris-Peace-Conference\">Paris Peace Conference</a> that formally concluded <a href=\"/event/World-War-I\">World War I</a>, Hughes was his fire-eating self, especially in defense of Australia’s interests in the Pacific. Thus he won a <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mandate\">mandate</a> for erstwhile German <a href=\"/place/New-Guinea\">New Guinea</a> and <a href=\"/place/Nauru\">Nauru</a> (an atoll in the central Pacific) and effectually opposed a Japanese motion proclaiming racial <a href=\"/topic/equality-human-rights\">equality</a>, which he thought might presage an attack on Australia’s <a href=\"/topic/immigration\">immigration</a> laws. In the <a href=\"/topic/League-of-Nations\">League of Nations</a>, Australia was an independent member from the outset. Yet in following years “the empire” became the object of even more <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rhetoric\">rhetoric</a> and more desperate hope than earlier. Australia did not ratify the <a href=\"/event/Statute-of-Westminster\">Statute of Westminster</a> (1931, embodying the 1926 <a href=\"/topic/Balfour-Report\">Balfour Report</a> as to the constitutional equality of the dominions) until 1942. The UAP <a href=\"/topic/government\">governments</a> followed Britain closely in its attitude toward the totalitarian expansion of the 1930s; if Australian influence counted for anything, it was to strengthen <a href=\"/topic/appeasement-foreign-policy\">appeasement</a> of <a href=\"/place/Germany\">Germany</a> and <a href=\"/place/Japan\">Japan</a>. Although fear of Japan continued, that country’s accession to the fascist camp did not provoke a tougher governmental line. The government suspected that Britain could not control the <a href=\"/place/Eastern-Hemisphere\">Eastern Hemisphere</a> but found no answer to that dire problem. The Labor Party meanwhile was even more incoherent and variable in matters of <a href=\"/topic/foreign-policy\">foreign policy</a> than were its social democratic counterparts elsewhere in the Western world: <a href=\"/topic/isolationism-foreign-policy\">isolationism</a> and antifascism were equal and opposing forces."],"sections":[],"isFilled":true},{"level":4,"id":"ref42428","sidebarHeader":"World War II","header":"World War II","paragraphs":["When <a href=\"/topic/war\">war</a> came again, however, the nation’s response was firm—some 30,000 Australians died in <a href=\"/event/World-War-II\">World War II</a> (1938–45), and 65,000 were injured. From early in the war, the Royal Australian Air Force was active in the defense of Britain. The Australian Navy operated in the <a href=\"/place/Mediterranean-Sea\">Mediterranean Sea</a> (1940–41), helping to win the Battle of Cape Matapan (March 1941). Australian troops fought in the seesaw battles of <a href=\"/place/North-Africa\">North Africa</a>.","In mid-1941 Australians suffered heavy losses both in the Allied defeats in <a href=\"/place/Greece\">Greece</a> and <a href=\"/place/Crete\">Crete</a> and in the victories in the <a href=\"/place/Levant\">Levant</a>. Meanwhile, the German general <a href=\"/biography/Erwin-Rommel\">Erwin Rommel</a> was scoring his greatest triumphs in North Africa. Out of these emerged the successful Allied defense of <a href=\"/place/Tobruk\">Tobruk</a>, carried out substantially by Australians (April–December 1941), and the decisive victory at the battles of <a href=\"/place/El-Alamein\">El-Alamein</a>, in which an Australian division played a key role.","After the <a href=\"/topic/history-of-Japan\">Japanese</a> attacked the U.S. naval base at <a href=\"/topic/Pearl-Harbor\">Pearl Harbor</a>, <a href=\"/place/Hawaii-state\">Hawaii</a> (December 7, 1941), however, the focus shifted homeward. The Japanese victories of the following months more than fulfilled the fantasies that fear and hate had long prompted in Australia. On February 15, 1942, 15,000 Australians became prisoners of war when <a href=\"/place/Singapore\">Singapore</a> fell to Japanese forces, and four days later war came to the nation’s shores when <a href=\"/place/Darwin-Northern-Territory\">Darwin</a> was bombed. Then came a Japanese swing southward that by August threatened to overrun <a href=\"/place/Port-Moresby\">Port Moresby</a>, <a href=\"/place/New-Guinea\">New Guinea</a>.","When Australia entered the war, compulsory military training was reintroduced by the Menzies government and commenced in January 1940. All unmarried men age 21  were required to complete three months of compulsory military training in the Citizen Military Forces (also known as the Militia). Because the Defence Act of 1903 restricted conscription to soldiers fighting on Australian land, a separate volunteer force, the 2nd Australian Imperial Force, was established to send troops to fight abroad while the Citizens Military Force defended the homeland and its territories.","In 1942 the worsening situation in the Pacific and in Southeast Asia, along with the consequent threat of a Japanese land invasion in northern Australia, caused widespread panic in Australia and led the government to take drastic measures to protect the country and its territories. John Curtin, leader of the Australian Labor Party, who had succeeded Menzies as prime minister, reversed his strong personal opposition to compulsory overseas military service to allow the government to conscript soldiers to fight the Japanese in the “South-West Pacific Area.” Enacted on February 19, 1943, the Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Act of 1943 extended the defense of Australia to include the territory of New Guinea and adjacent islands, thus allowing for the conscription of Australian troops to serve in the “South-Western Pacific Zone.”","The <a href=\"/place/United-States\">United States</a> became Australia’s major ally. In a famous statement (December 1941), Prime Minister Curtin declared: “I make it quite clear that Australia looks to America, free from any pangs about our traditional links of friendship to Britain.” A sharper note of independence from Britain came when Curtin insisted (February 1942) that Australian troops recalled from the <a href=\"/place/Middle-East\">Middle East</a> should return to Australia itself and not help in the defense of Burma (<a href=\"/place/Myanmar\">Myanmar</a>) as British Prime Minister <a href=\"/biography/Winston-Churchill\">Winston Churchill</a> wished. Conversely, American needs prompted total response to Curtin’s call. U.S. Gen. <a href=\"/biography/Douglas-MacArthur\">Douglas MacArthur</a>, commander in chief of the South-West Pacific Area, established his headquarters first in <a href=\"/place/Melbourne-Queensland\">Melbourne</a> and then in <a href=\"/plant/Brisbane-box\">Brisbane</a>.","The large U.S. military presence in Brisbane was not without problems. When American troops began arriving in Australia in December 1941, their presence was warmly welcomed. However, Australian attitudes toward them began to change, particularly the attitude of Australian soldiers who felt threatened by the attention Australian women showed toward the better-paid, more stylishly uniformed American soldiers. The increasing tension erupted into the “<a href=\"/event/Battle-of-Brisbane\">Battle of Brisbane</a>,” two nights of large-scale rioting that took place between Australians and U.S. servicemen in Brisbane’s central business district on November 26–27, 1942. One Australian died and hundreds were wounded on both sides as a result of the violent clash.","Brisbane also figured large in an <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alleged\">alleged</a> defense strategy that ultimately proved to be a canard, according to which, in the event of a Japanese invasion, the northern parts of the continent beyond “the Brisbane Line” between Brisbane and Perth were to have been conceded to the enemy without resistance. Supposedly, the objective of this plan was to concentrate Australian armed forces between Brisbane and Melbourne, where most of the crucial industrial regions were located. The idea was that the sheer distance that would have to be traveled by Japanese forces to reach the Brisbane Line would be debilitating for them.","During an election campaign in October 1942, Labor minister Edward Ward accused the previous Menzies and Fadden governments of having planned this strategy, though he had no evidence to support his claims. MacArthur’s mention of the “Brisbane Line” to reporters in March 1943 sparked further public concern and controversy. A Royal Commission  that operated from June to September 1943, however, determined that no such plan had ever existed as an official policy. Indeed, MacArthur decided that the best way to stop Japanese forces from advancing to Australia was to make a stand in New Guinea.","Meanwhile, on land, the fortunes of <a href=\"/topic/war\">war</a> turned against the Japanese in August–September 1942, beginning with an Allied (primarily Australian) victory at <a href=\"/place/Milne-Bay\">Milne Bay</a>, New Guinea. More prolonged—and of more heroic dimension in Australian eyes—was the forcing back of the Japanese from southern New Guinea over the Kokoda Track (or Trail), along which Australian soldiers put up strong resistance against seemingly overwhelming odds. The Japanese, having failed to capture <a href=\"/place/Port-Moresby\">Port Moresby</a> by sea in the <a href=\"/event/Battle-of-the-Coral-Sea\">Battle of the Coral Sea</a> (May 4–8, 1942), landed in northern New Guinea at the beachheads of Gona and Buna on July 21, 1942, with the intention of taking the New Guinea capital by pushing south over the rugged <a href=\"/place/Owen-Stanley-Range\">Owen Stanley Range</a> along the Kokoda Track. In a series of engagements during what proved to be a four-month campaign, Australian troops eventually forced their more powerful adversary to withdraw, retaking the Kokoda region on November 2, 1942. Their actions arguably saved Australia from Japanese invasion and, as such, formed a defining moment in Australian history. The endurance, courage, “mateship,” and never-give-up attitude the Australian soldiers displayed during the campaign fostered the so-called ANZAC <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legend\">legend</a>, the tradition of the indomitable spirit of Australian troops that began with the original<a href=\"/topic/ANZAC\"> ANZAC</a>s in the <a href=\"/event/Gallipoli-Campaign\">Gallipoli Campaign</a> of 1915 and continues today as an important element of national identity.","A long <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attrition\">attrition</a> of Japanese forces elsewhere in New Guinea and the islands followed the <a href=\"/event/Kokoda-Track-Campaign\">Kokoda Track Campaign</a>, with Australia initially playing a major role and subsequently playing a role secondary to American forces. Both Australian volunteers and conscripts fought in these campaigns, the government and people having accepted the legitimacy of sending conscripts as far north as the <a href=\"/place/Equator\">Equator</a> and as far west and east as the 110th and 159th <a href=\"/science/meridian-geography\">meridians</a>.","Because defeat in the Battles of the Coral Sea and <a href=\"/event/Battle-of-Midway\">Midway</a> prevented Japan from continuing to supply its forces in Burma (<a href=\"/place/Myanmar\">Myanmar</a>) by sea, the Japanese high command undertook the building of a rail line between <a href=\"/place/Thailand\">Thailand</a> and Burma. In addition to Asian labourers, more than 60,000 Allied <a href=\"/topic/prisoner-of-war\">prisoners of war</a> (POWs), including about 13,000 Australians, were forced to construct the 260-mile (415-km) Burma (Thai-Burma) Railway Line. Subject to cruel punishment and torture, the POWs also suffered from disease and malnutrition. As a result, more than one-fifth of them, including more than 2,800 Australians, died during the yearlong (October 1942–October 1943) construction of the railway. The will to survive exhibited by the Australian POWs—including Lieut. Col. <a href=\"/biography/Weary-Dunlop\">Ernest Edward (“Weary”) Dunlop</a>, an army surgeon who risked his life by standing up to his Japanese captors to protect the men in his care—contributed further to the ANZAC legend.","There were more than two dozen POW camps in Australia. On August 5, 1944, one of the largest POW breakouts in history occurred at the facility in <a href=\"/place/Cowra\">Cowra</a> in east-central New South Wales. In the wee hours of the morning, more than 1,100 Japanese POWs staged a mass breakout, storming the barbed-wire fence surrounding the camp. More than 300 prisoners managed to escape, but within nine days all of the escapees who had not chosen to kill themselves were recaptured. In all, 231 Japanese POWs died as a result of the breakout.","The war brought some passion into domestic affairs, <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/albeit\">albeit</a> less than in <a href=\"/event/World-War-I\">World War I</a>. Curtin’s government exercised considerable control over the civilian population, “industrial conscription” being scarcely an exaggerated description. Overall, this was accepted—partly because of the crisis, partly because the <a href=\"/topic/government\">government</a> showed purposefulness and capacity. Curtin easily won the 1943 <a href=\"/topic/election-political-science\">elections</a>. Thereafter, his ministry and the <a href=\"/topic/bureaucracy\">bureaucracy</a> gave considerable thought to postwar reconstruction, hoping to use war-developed techniques to achieve greater social justice in <a href=\"/topic/Peace-play-by-Aristophanes\">peace</a>.","The war carried <a href=\"/topic/industrialization\">industrialization</a> to a new level. The production of ammunition and other matériel (including airplanes), machine tools, and chemicals all boomed. Meanwhile, primary production lost <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prestige\">prestige</a>, aid, and skills, so that the 1944 output was but two-thirds that of 1939–40. Urban employment was bountiful, and concentration in the state capitals became more marked than ever. Many families had two or more income earners. Thus, affluence quickened. Federal child endowment from 1940 and rationing of scarce products helped distribute this <a href=\"/topic/distribution-of-wealth-and-income\">wealth</a>. The <a href=\"/topic/gross-national-product\">gross national product</a> increased by more than one-half between 1938–39 and 1942–43 and by the end of that time was nearly triple what it had been at the end of World War I.","World War II also proved to be a significant turning point in the role of women, and the wartime efforts of various women’s groups and their volunteer service to the community were recognized and praised. More women also joined the workforce to replace men who had left for war, bringing about a significant change in the traditional role of women, who had previously remained in the home to manage domestic responsibilities and raise children.

In the agricultural sector there was significant expansion of exports, with <a href=\"/plant/wheat\">wheat</a>, <a href=\"/science/fruit-plant-reproductive-body\">fruits</a>, <a href=\"/topic/meat\">meat</a>, and <a href=\"/science/sugar-chemical-compound\">sugar</a> becoming much more important than theretofore. But just as manufactures received increasingly high tariff protection, so the marketing of these goods often depended on subsidy. Hence, the <a href=\"/animal/sheep\">sheep</a>’s back continued to be the nation’s great support in world finance. <a href=\"/science/metal-chemistry\">Metals</a>, gold especially, were important in the early years, but thereafter this resource conspicuously failed to provide the vitality of earlier and later times. The worldwide economic depression of the 1930s affected Australia, especially its primary industries. Otherwise, the overall rate of growth, and probably of living standards, too, scrambled upward—more quickly than average in the years around 1910 and again in the early 1940s.","In national politics, candidates fought for office with increasing vigour and resource, while their administrative performances generally began well but then ebbed. A constant theme was the strengthening of the central government against the states. This complemented the high <a href=\"/topic/degree-education\">degree</a> of <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/homogeneity\">homogeneity</a>, especially in personal and social matters, that extended through Australia’s great physical spread; it was expressed primarily through the Commonwealth’s financial powers—at first especially relating to customs and excise duties but later by direct taxation. From <a href=\"/event/World-War-I\">World War I</a> (1914–18) both levels of government imposed income taxes, but in 1942 the federal <a href=\"/topic/government\">government</a> virtually annexed the field, with the high court’s approval. The establishment of a national capital at <a href=\"/place/Canberra\">Canberra</a>, where Parliament first sat in 1927 after having met in Melbourne since federation, symbolized this situation. The strengthening of the <a href=\"/topic/Commonwealth-association-of-states\">Commonwealth</a> was scarcely a product of popular enthusiasm. Several constitutional referenda upheld the rights of the states, each of which had its own distinct political, cultural, and social characteristics.","The first two <a href=\"/topic/prime-minister\">prime ministers</a> were <a href=\"/biography/Edmund-Barton\">Edmund Barton</a> (1901–03) and <a href=\"/biography/Alfred-Deakin\">Alfred Deakin</a> (1903–04), who had headed the federation movement in <a href=\"/place/New-South-Wales\">New South Wales</a> and <a href=\"/place/Victoria-state-Australia\">Victoria</a>, respectively. They were liberal protectionists. Their ministries established a tariff, an administrative structure, and the <a href=\"/event/White-Australia-Policy\">White Australia</a> <a href=\"/topic/immigration\">immigration</a> policy that excluded Asians. They also established the High Court and initiated legislation for a court of conciliation and arbitration. This carried to the highest point in the world the principles of industrial arbitration and judicial imposition of welfare and <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/justice\">justice</a> through <a href=\"/topic/wage\">wage</a> and working-condition awards.","In 1904 <a href=\"/biography/John-Christian-Watson\">John Christian Watson</a> led the first, brief Labor cabinet, followed by <a href=\"/biography/George-Houston-Reid\">George Houston Reid</a>’s conservative free-trade ministry. Deakin led again (1905–08), and <a href=\"/biography/Andrew-Fisher\">Andrew Fisher</a> was Labor’s second prime minister (1908–09); his ministry was defeated when liberals and <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conservatives\">conservatives</a> “fused” in Deakin’s third term (1909–10). Labor then won its first clear majority at election, which it barely lost in 1913 and regained, still under Fisher, in 1914. These changing <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ideologies\">ideologies</a> did not hinder—perhaps even prompted—ambitious governmental policies. Social services were extended with old-age pensions (1908) and maternity grants (1912); protection rose markedly in a 1908 tariff; the Commonwealth Bank was established; and an army and navy developed.","The new nation was psychologically as well as physically prepared for war. Fear of attack became increasingly directed against <a href=\"/place/Japan\">Japan</a>, prompting pressure on <a href=\"/place/Great-Britain-island-Europe\">Great Britain</a> for a firmer policy in the New Hebrides (since 1886 supervised jointly by Britain and <a href=\"/place/France\">France</a>); this was achieved in 1906–07. Although many Australians criticized Britain when the latter appeared negligent of local interests, the dominant note was profound loyalty to the empire. Colonial troops had fought in both the <a href=\"/place/Sudan\">Sudan</a> and South African (Boer) wars. In 1914, when <a href=\"/event/World-War-I\">World War I</a> began, politicians of all hues rallied to the imperial cause."],"sections":[],"isFilled":true},"ref42426":{"level":4,"id":"ref42426","sidebarHeader":"World War I","header":"World War I","paragraphs":["Some 330,000 Australians served in World War I; 60,000 died, and 165,000 suffered wounds.

The most famous engagement of the <a href=\"/place/Australia\">Australia</a> and <a href=\"/place/New-Zealand\">New Zealand</a> Army Corps (<a href=\"/topic/ANZAC\">ANZAC</a>) was in the <a href=\"/event/Gallipoli-Campaign\">Dardanelles Campaign</a> (1915); the day of the landing at Gallipoli—April 25—became the preeminent day of national reverence. Even before Gallipoli, Australian troops had occupied German New Guinea, and the Australian warship <em>Sydney</em> sank the German cruiser <em>Emden</em> near the <a href=\"/place/Cocos-Islands\">Cocos Islands</a> (November 9, 1914).

Such products as <a href=\"/topic/wool\">wool</a>, <a href=\"/plant/wheat\">wheat</a>, <a href=\"/topic/beef\">beef</a>, and mutton found a readier market in Britain, at inflated prices. But the shock of war affected politics much more, especially by giving full scope to the furious energy of <a href=\"/biography/William-Morris-Hughes\">William Morris Hughes</a>, who supplanted Fisher as Labor prime minister in October 1915. Soon afterward he visited Britain. There his ferocity as a war leader won acclaim, and he became convinced that Australia must contribute still more. He advocated military <a href=\"/topic/conscription\">conscription</a>, but many Australians felt that the government should not force men to fight in overseas wars, and the large-scale casualties of the war reinforced this notion. A <a href=\"/topic/referendum\">referendum</a> seeking approval for conscription was defeated in October 1916, and immediately afterward the Labor parliamentary <a href=\"/topic/caucus-politics\">caucus</a> moved no confidence in Hughes’s leadership. He continued as <a href=\"/topic/prime-minister\">prime minister</a> of a “national” government, however, even after losing a second conscription referendum in December 1917. The referenda in particular and war stress in general made these years uniquely turbulent in Australian history. The Labor Party lost other men of great ability along with Hughes. The split solidified a long-standing trend for Roman Catholics to support the party. Hughes’s enemies also included the small but growing number of extremists—most notably the Sydney section of the <a href=\"/topic/Industrial-Workers-of-the-World\">Industrial Workers of the World</a> (IWW)—who opposed the war on doctrinaire grounds."],"sections":[],"isFilled":true},"ref42427":{"level":4,"id":"ref42427","sidebarHeader":"The postwar years","header":"The postwar years","paragraphs":["The aftermath of <a href=\"/topic/war\">war</a> continued, but finally resolved, this turbulence. Some radicals hoped that returning servicemen would force <a href=\"/topic/social-change\">social change</a>, but instead the Returned Sailors’ and Soldiers’ Imperial League of Australia (later called the Returned Services League of Australia) became a bastion of conservative order, some of its supporters ready to use physical force against local people they considered “bolsheviks.” The Labor Party faltered, its members adopting a more radical socialist type of platform in 1921, but with far from uniform <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conviction\">conviction</a>. (In 1918 the name <a href=\"/topic/Australian-Labor-Party\">Australian Labor Party</a> [ALP] was adopted throughout Australia.) When the challenge came to Hughes’s leadership early in 1923, it arose partly from the conservative-business wing of Hughes’s own <a href=\"/topic/Nationalist-Party-Chinese-political-party\">Nationalist Party</a> (its representative, <a href=\"/biography/Stanley-Melbourne-Bruce\">Stanley Melbourne Bruce</a>, becoming prime minister) and partly from the <a href=\"/topic/the-Nationals\">Country Party</a>, which from late 1922 held a crucial number of parliamentary seats. Although led by wealthy landowners, the Country Party won support from many small farmers. It benefited too from its former-soldier image and from widespread country-versus-city feeling. Its leader, <a href=\"/biography/Earle-Christmas-Grafton-Page\">Earle C.G. Page</a>, had considerable, if erratic, force.","Bruce continued as prime minister until 1929, with Page his deputy in Nationalist-Country <a href=\"/topic/coalition\">coalitions</a>. Bruce strove to buoy the economy by attracting British investment and fostering corporative <a href=\"/topic/capitalism\">capitalism</a>. Tariffs, bounties, prices, and public indebtedness all rose. There was considerable administrative innovation—e.g., the Loan Council regulated all <a href=\"/topic/government\">government</a> borrowing—and the successful Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (later called the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation [CSIRO]) was established in 1926 to apply scientific expertise to developmental problems. The worldwide development of consumer industry had its impact: the revolution in <a href=\"/technology/transportation-technology\">transportation</a> provided by the automobile is the best example, although full-scale car production was still in the future.","With much economic activity subsidized—the exception being one primary product, wool—Australia was particularly <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vulnerable\">vulnerable</a> to the <a href=\"/event/Great-Depression\">Great Depression</a> of the 1930s. It struck hard: unemployment exceeded one-fourth of the <a href=\"/science/labor-childbirth\">work force</a> and imposed a degree of social misery rarely known in Australian history. The rate of recovery was uneven, manufactures doing better than primary industry. <a href=\"/science/population-biology-and-anthropology\">Population</a> growth slowed; at the nadir, emigration exceeded immigration.","Politics reflected the impact. <a href=\"/biography/James-Henry-Scullin\">James Henry Scullin</a> succeeded Bruce as <a href=\"/topic/prime-minister\">prime minister</a> in October 1929, but his Labor ministry suffered the real squeeze of events; within the ALP there was considerable division as to how government should react to the Depression. Some favoured a generally inflationist policy, with banks <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/facilitating\">facilitating</a> credit issue and governments extending <a href=\"/technology/public-utility\">public works</a>. Right-wing Labor distrusted such a policy; <a href=\"/topic/radical-ideologist\">radicals</a> would have gone further by renouncing interest payment on overseas loans. Conservative opinion argued for deflationary policies—curtailed government expenditure, lower wages, balancing the budget, and the honouring of interest commitments. In June 1931 the <a href=\"/topic/Commonwealth-association-of-states\">Commonwealth</a> and the state governments agreed on a plan, called the Premiers’ Plan. Although the plan had some inflationary features, it foreshadowed a one-fifth reduction in government spending, including <a href=\"/topic/wage\">wages</a> and <a href=\"/topic/pension\">pensions</a>—a considerable affront to Labor’s traditional attitudes.","Against this background the government disintegrated. Before the Premiers’ Plan, some Labor right-wingers, led by <a href=\"/biography/Joseph-Aloysius-Lyons\">Joseph Aloysius Lyons</a>, had crossed to the opposition. In November some leftist dissidents voted against Scullin, forcing his resignation. In the elections that followed, Labor suffered a heavy defeat. The new prime minister was Lyons, whose followers had coalesced with the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/erstwhile\">erstwhile</a> Nationalists to form the <a href=\"/topic/United-Australia-Party\">United Australia Party</a> (UAP). Lyons led a wholly UAP government until 1934 and UAP-Country coalitions until his death in 1939.","The Lyons governments provided stability and not much more. Recovery was uneven and sporadic, quicker in manufacturing than in primary industry, aided more by market forces than by governmental planning. Two policies failed to fulfill expectations—the Imperial Economic Conference, held at Ottawa, Ontario, <a href=\"/place/Canada\">Canada</a>, in 1932, improved trade slightly, but the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integrated\">integrated</a> economic <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community\">community</a> for which some had hoped never developed. Australia’s trade diversion policy of 1936, which tried to redress the imbalance of imports from <a href=\"/place/Japan\">Japan</a> and the United States, offended those countries and actually reduced exports further. A plan for national <a href=\"/topic/insurance\">insurance</a>, the Lyons governments’ most ambitious social legislation, also aborted. These mishaps did not much bother the electorate; improvement, even if meagre, was enough to retain favour.","Internal division was the greater threat to the government. This became <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manifest\">manifest</a> after Lyons’s death. The UAP elected <a href=\"/biography/Robert-Menzies\">Robert Gordon Menzies</a> its new leader (and therefore prime minister); but the decision was hard fought, and it was criticized publicly and vehemently by Page, still leader of the Country Party. Nevertheless, Menzies retained office; but internal division persisted, the <a href=\"/topic/coalition\">coalition</a>’s parliamentary majority was tiny, and Menzies resigned in August 1941. Arthur William Fadden, the new leader of the Country Party, then took office, but in October he gave way to <a href=\"/biography/John-Curtin\">John Curtin</a> and a Labor ministry.","While the electorate generally voted conservative, Australia shared the common Western experience of the interwar years in the rise of a small, vigorous communist movement. Founded in 1922, the Australian Communist Party made most headway in the big industrial unions and in Sydney; it also had some influence and supporters among the intelligentsia, especially in the 1930s. The party suffered a share of internal factionalism but for the most part was able to present a united face to the public.","<a href=\"/topic/fascism\">Fascism</a> achieved no formal political recognition in Australia, but there were hints of sympathy toward fascist attitudes—<a href=\"/biography/D-H-Lawrence\">D.H. Lawrence</a> wrote of such in his novel <em>Kangaroo</em>, based on a brief visit in 1922; and an “Australia First” movement began in literary <a href=\"/topic/nationalism\">nationalism</a> but drifted into race mystique and perhaps even <a href=\"/topic/treason\">treason</a>. An <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intellectual\">intellectual</a> movement of more lasting force developed among a group of young Roman Catholic <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intellectuals\">intellectuals</a> in <a href=\"/place/Melbourne-Queensland\">Melbourne</a> in the mid-1930s. They developed a commitment to social justice and against <a href=\"/topic/communism\">communism</a>, somewhat in the manner of <a href=\"/biography/G-K-Chesterton\">G.K. Chesterton</a>. This was known as the <a href=\"/topic/Catholic-Social-Movement\">Catholic Social Movement</a>, and it had considerable influence.","Whereas Australia had been virtually spoiling for war before 1914, passivity became the international keynote after 1920. At the <a href=\"/event/Paris-Peace-Conference\">Paris Peace Conference</a> that formally concluded <a href=\"/event/World-War-I\">World War I</a>, Hughes was his fire-eating self, especially in defense of Australia’s interests in the Pacific. Thus he won a <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mandate\">mandate</a> for erstwhile German <a href=\"/place/New-Guinea\">New Guinea</a> and <a href=\"/place/Nauru\">Nauru</a> (an atoll in the central Pacific) and effectually opposed a Japanese motion proclaiming racial <a href=\"/topic/equality-human-rights\">equality</a>, which he thought might presage an attack on Australia’s <a href=\"/topic/immigration\">immigration</a> laws. In the <a href=\"/topic/League-of-Nations\">League of Nations</a>, Australia was an independent member from the outset. Yet in following years “the empire” became the object of even more <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rhetoric\">rhetoric</a> and more desperate hope than earlier. Australia did not ratify the <a href=\"/event/Statute-of-Westminster\">Statute of Westminster</a> (1931, embodying the 1926 <a href=\"/topic/Balfour-Report\">Balfour Report</a> as to the constitutional equality of the dominions) until 1942. The UAP <a href=\"/topic/government\">governments</a> followed Britain closely in its attitude toward the totalitarian expansion of the 1930s; if Australian influence counted for anything, it was to strengthen <a href=\"/topic/appeasement-foreign-policy\">appeasement</a> of <a href=\"/place/Germany\">Germany</a> and <a href=\"/place/Japan\">Japan</a>. Although fear of Japan continued, that country’s accession to the fascist camp did not provoke a tougher governmental line. The government suspected that Britain could not control the <a href=\"/place/Eastern-Hemisphere\">Eastern Hemisphere</a> but found no answer to that dire problem. The Labor Party meanwhile was even more incoherent and variable in matters of <a href=\"/topic/foreign-policy\">foreign policy</a> than were its social democratic counterparts elsewhere in the Western world: <a href=\"/topic/isolationism-foreign-policy\">isolationism</a> and antifascism were equal and opposing forces."],"sections":[],"isFilled":true},"ref42428":{"level":4,"id":"ref42428","sidebarHeader":"World War II","header":"World War II","paragraphs":["When <a href=\"/topic/war\">war</a> came again, however, the nation’s response was firm—some 30,000 Australians died in <a href=\"/event/World-War-II\">World War II</a> (1938–45), and 65,000 were injured. From early in the war, the Royal Australian Air Force was active in the defense of Britain. The Australian Navy operated in the <a href=\"/place/Mediterranean-Sea\">Mediterranean Sea</a> (1940–41), helping to win the Battle of Cape Matapan (March 1941). Australian troops fought in the seesaw battles of <a href=\"/place/North-Africa\">North Africa</a>.","In mid-1941 Australians suffered heavy losses both in the Allied defeats in <a href=\"/place/Greece\">Greece</a> and <a href=\"/place/Crete\">Crete</a> and in the victories in the <a href=\"/place/Levant\">Levant</a>. Meanwhile, the German general <a href=\"/biography/Erwin-Rommel\">Erwin Rommel</a> was scoring his greatest triumphs in North Africa. Out of these emerged the successful Allied defense of <a href=\"/place/Tobruk\">Tobruk</a>, carried out substantially by Australians (April–December 1941), and the decisive victory at the battles of <a href=\"/place/El-Alamein\">El-Alamein</a>, in which an Australian division played a key role.","After the <a href=\"/topic/history-of-Japan\">Japanese</a> attacked the U.S. naval base at <a href=\"/topic/Pearl-Harbor\">Pearl Harbor</a>, <a href=\"/place/Hawaii-state\">Hawaii</a> (December 7, 1941), however, the focus shifted homeward. The Japanese victories of the following months more than fulfilled the fantasies that fear and hate had long prompted in Australia. On February 15, 1942, 15,000 Australians became prisoners of war when <a href=\"/place/Singapore\">Singapore</a> fell to Japanese forces, and four days later war came to the nation’s shores when <a href=\"/place/Darwin-Northern-Territory\">Darwin</a> was bombed. Then came a Japanese swing southward that by August threatened to overrun <a href=\"/place/Port-Moresby\">Port Moresby</a>, <a href=\"/place/New-Guinea\">New Guinea</a>.","When Australia entered the war, compulsory military training was reintroduced by the Menzies government and commenced in January 1940. All unmarried men age 21  were required to complete three months of compulsory military training in the Citizen Military Forces (also known as the Militia). Because the Defence Act of 1903 restricted conscription to soldiers fighting on Australian land, a separate volunteer force, the 2nd Australian Imperial Force, was established to send troops to fight abroad while the Citizens Military Force defended the homeland and its territories.","In 1942 the worsening situation in the Pacific and in Southeast Asia, along with the consequent threat of a Japanese land invasion in northern Australia, caused widespread panic in Australia and led the government to take drastic measures to protect the country and its territories. John Curtin, leader of the Australian Labor Party, who had succeeded Menzies as prime minister, reversed his strong personal opposition to compulsory overseas military service to allow the government to conscript soldiers to fight the Japanese in the “South-West Pacific Area.” Enacted on February 19, 1943, the Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Act of 1943 extended the defense of Australia to include the territory of New Guinea and adjacent islands, thus allowing for the conscription of Australian troops to serve in the “South-Western Pacific Zone.”","The <a href=\"/place/United-States\">United States</a> became Australia’s major ally. In a famous statement (December 1941), Prime Minister Curtin declared: “I make it quite clear that Australia looks to America, free from any pangs about our traditional links of friendship to Britain.” A sharper note of independence from Britain came when Curtin insisted (February 1942) that Australian troops recalled from the <a href=\"/place/Middle-East\">Middle East</a> should return to Australia itself and not help in the defense of Burma (<a href=\"/place/Myanmar\">Myanmar</a>) as British Prime Minister <a href=\"/biography/Winston-Churchill\">Winston Churchill</a> wished. Conversely, American needs prompted total response to Curtin’s call. U.S. Gen. <a href=\"/biography/Douglas-MacArthur\">Douglas MacArthur</a>, commander in chief of the South-West Pacific Area, established his headquarters first in <a href=\"/place/Melbourne-Queensland\">Melbourne</a> and then in <a href=\"/plant/Brisbane-box\">Brisbane</a>.","The large U.S. military presence in Brisbane was not without problems. When American troops began arriving in Australia in December 1941, their presence was warmly welcomed. However, Australian attitudes toward them began to change, particularly the attitude of Australian soldiers who felt threatened by the attention Australian women showed toward the better-paid, more stylishly uniformed American soldiers. The increasing tension erupted into the “<a href=\"/event/Battle-of-Brisbane\">Battle of Brisbane</a>,” two nights of large-scale rioting that took place between Australians and U.S. servicemen in Brisbane’s central business district on November 26–27, 1942. One Australian died and hundreds were wounded on both sides as a result of the violent clash.","Brisbane also figured large in an <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alleged\">alleged</a> defense strategy that ultimately proved to be a canard, according to which, in the event of a Japanese invasion, the northern parts of the continent beyond “the Brisbane Line” between Brisbane and Perth were to have been conceded to the enemy without resistance. Supposedly, the objective of this plan was to concentrate Australian armed forces between Brisbane and Melbourne, where most of the crucial industrial regions were located. The idea was that the sheer distance that would have to be traveled by Japanese forces to reach the Brisbane Line would be debilitating for them.","During an election campaign in October 1942, Labor minister Edward Ward accused the previous Menzies and Fadden governments of having planned this strategy, though he had no evidence to support his claims. MacArthur’s mention of the “Brisbane Line” to reporters in March 1943 sparked further public concern and controversy. A Royal Commission  that operated from June to September 1943, however, determined that no such plan had ever existed as an official policy. Indeed, MacArthur decided that the best way to stop Japanese forces from advancing to Australia was to make a stand in New Guinea.","Meanwhile, on land, the fortunes of <a href=\"/topic/war\">war</a> turned against the Japanese in August–September 1942, beginning with an Allied (primarily Australian) victory at <a href=\"/place/Milne-Bay\">Milne Bay</a>, New Guinea. More prolonged—and of more heroic dimension in Australian eyes—was the forcing back of the Japanese from southern New Guinea over the Kokoda Track (or Trail), along which Australian soldiers put up strong resistance against seemingly overwhelming odds. The Japanese, having failed to capture <a href=\"/place/Port-Moresby\">Port Moresby</a> by sea in the <a href=\"/event/Battle-of-the-Coral-Sea\">Battle of the Coral Sea</a> (May 4–8, 1942), landed in northern New Guinea at the beachheads of Gona and Buna on July 21, 1942, with the intention of taking the New Guinea capital by pushing south over the rugged <a href=\"/place/Owen-Stanley-Range\">Owen Stanley Range</a> along the Kokoda Track. In a series of engagements during what proved to be a four-month campaign, Australian troops eventually forced their more powerful adversary to withdraw, retaking the Kokoda region on November 2, 1942. Their actions arguably saved Australia from Japanese invasion and, as such, formed a defining moment in Australian history. The endurance, courage, “mateship,” and never-give-up attitude the Australian soldiers displayed during the campaign fostered the so-called ANZAC <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legend\">legend</a>, the tradition of the indomitable spirit of Australian troops that began with the original<a href=\"/topic/ANZAC\"> ANZAC</a>s in the <a href=\"/event/Gallipoli-Campaign\">Gallipoli Campaign</a> of 1915 and continues today as an important element of national identity.","A long <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attrition\">attrition</a> of Japanese forces elsewhere in New Guinea and the islands followed the <a href=\"/event/Kokoda-Track-Campaign\">Kokoda Track Campaign</a>, with Australia initially playing a major role and subsequently playing a role secondary to American forces. Both Australian volunteers and conscripts fought in these campaigns, the government and people having accepted the legitimacy of sending conscripts as far north as the <a href=\"/place/Equator\">Equator</a> and as far west and east as the 110th and 159th <a href=\"/science/meridian-geography\">meridians</a>.","Because defeat in the Battles of the Coral Sea and <a href=\"/event/Battle-of-Midway\">Midway</a> prevented Japan from continuing to supply its forces in Burma (<a href=\"/place/Myanmar\">Myanmar</a>) by sea, the Japanese high command undertook the building of a rail line between <a href=\"/place/Thailand\">Thailand</a> and Burma. In addition to Asian labourers, more than 60,000 Allied <a href=\"/topic/prisoner-of-war\">prisoners of war</a> (POWs), including about 13,000 Australians, were forced to construct the 260-mile (415-km) Burma (Thai-Burma) Railway Line. Subject to cruel punishment and torture, the POWs also suffered from disease and malnutrition. As a result, more than one-fifth of them, including more than 2,800 Australians, died during the yearlong (October 1942–October 1943) construction of the railway. The will to survive exhibited by the Australian POWs—including Lieut. Col. <a href=\"/biography/Weary-Dunlop\">Ernest Edward (“Weary”) Dunlop</a>, an army surgeon who risked his life by standing up to his Japanese captors to protect the men in his care—contributed further to the ANZAC legend.","There were more than two dozen POW camps in Australia. On August 5, 1944, one of the largest POW breakouts in history occurred at the facility in <a href=\"/place/Cowra\">Cowra</a> in east-central New South Wales. In the wee hours of the morning, more than 1,100 Japanese POWs staged a mass breakout, storming the barbed-wire fence surrounding the camp. More than 300 prisoners managed to escape, but within nine days all of the escapees who had not chosen to kill themselves were recaptured. In all, 231 Japanese POWs died as a result of the breakout.","The war brought some passion into domestic affairs, <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/albeit\">albeit</a> less than in <a href=\"/event/World-War-I\">World War I</a>. Curtin’s government exercised considerable control over the civilian population, “industrial conscription” being scarcely an exaggerated description. Overall, this was accepted—partly because of the crisis, partly because the <a href=\"/topic/government\">government</a> showed purposefulness and capacity. Curtin easily won the 1943 <a href=\"/topic/election-political-science\">elections</a>. Thereafter, his ministry and the <a href=\"/topic/bureaucracy\">bureaucracy</a> gave considerable thought to postwar reconstruction, hoping to use war-developed techniques to achieve greater social justice in <a href=\"/topic/Peace-play-by-Aristophanes\">peace</a>.","The war carried <a href=\"/topic/industrialization\">industrialization</a> to a new level. The production of ammunition and other matériel (including airplanes), machine tools, and chemicals all boomed. Meanwhile, primary production lost <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prestige\">prestige</a>, aid, and skills, so that the 1944 output was but two-thirds that of 1939–40. Urban employment was bountiful, and concentration in the state capitals became more marked than ever. Many families had two or more income earners. Thus, affluence quickened.

More women also joined the workforce to replace men who had left for war, bringing about a significant change in the traditional role of women, who had previously remained in the home to manage domestic responsibilities and raise children.

The arrival and presence of over 100,000  U.S. troops in Australia from 1941 had a substantial impact on postwar culture and society. The American alliance with Australia during the war forged close ties between the two countries, and Australia came to depend on the United States for military support as well as economic growth. Prior to the war, Australian society had been largely influenced by conservative British culture, mirroring its entertainment, music, and sports as well as its social attitudes. By the end of the war a significant change was underway, however, and from the 1950s onward Australian lifestyles felt the dramatic impact of the new more rebellious culture of the United States, which had emerged from the war in a powerful economic position.","The strong cultural influence that the United States exerted over other Western countries, especially Australia, was profound. Because Australia also experienced an economic boom as a result of the war, its newfound affluent position enabled Australians to embrace innovative new and now more-affordable products and technologies, many of which were imported from the more industrialized United States. American ideals and cultural products, such as film and music, quickly dispersed throughout Australian society, with an accompanying move away from the traditional restricted ways of prewar life to a more liberated and expressive lifestyle.","Film-going had become one of the most popular pastimes for Australian people during World War II, as motion pictures provided a form of escapism from the horrors of the real wartime world. In 1945 alone, 151 million cinema admissions were recorded in Australia. Most of the films shown on Australian screens between the 1940s and ’50s, however, were produced by American companies. Australian-made films were in very short supply in the early 1950s. Many of the American films appealed to a teenage audience with their depiction of radical American social themes and ideals. This exposure undoubtedly had an impact upon impressionable adolescents, sparking the birth of a new youth culture in Australia.","The introduction of <a href=\"/topic/television-broadcasting\">television</a> in Australia in September 1956 provided a new cultural experience and resulted in a dramatic decline in cinema attendance. Television quickly became one of the most popular forms of entertainment and one of the most influential mediums in the country. The Australian government had been determined to have the country’s first television network up and running in time for the Melbourne Olympic Games, and it met this objective with some two months to spare.","In the initial years after television’s arrival, not many Australians could afford the new technology.  However, as televisions became less expensive, the number of Australians who owned a television rapidly increased. Despite the enormous popularity of television, a small proportion of society opposed it, mainly because the majority of programs were American productions. With more than 80 percent of television content sourced from the United States, it was feared that American content, themes, and culture would impede the development of the Australian identity. This concern was <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alleviated\">alleviated</a> somewhat when the demand for an increase in Australian content led to the broadcasting of more Australian programs in the mid-1960s, particularly Australian dramatic series.","The proliferation of vinyl records after World War II had a major impact on the experience of music in Australia and revolutionized the music industry. By the early 1960s more than 500,000 records were being manufactured every month in Australia. This spike in record production coincided with the explosion of rebellious youth-oriented culture, sparked by the rise of <a href=\"/art/rock-and-roll-early-style-of-rock-music\">rock and roll</a>, the arrival of which in Australia is usually dated to the theatrical release in 1955 of <a href=\"/topic/Blackboard-Jungle\"></a>; the movie featured the hit single “Rock Around the Clock” by the American band <a href=\"/biography/Bill-Haley\">Bill Haley</a> and <a href=\"/topic/Bill-Haley-and-His-Comets\">His Comets</a>, whose Australian tour in 1957 was a sensation. Johnny O’Keefe became the first Australian rock singer to reach the national charts with the release of his hit “Wild One” in 1958. With the exciting new music came the creation of expressive new dance styles and trendy youthful clothing. Put off by the accompanying changes in behaviour, fashion, and attitudes, some in the older generation blamed rock and roll for the rise in <a href=\"/topic/delinquency\">juvenile delinquency</a>. But new music had come to stay, and in the successive decades many Australians would put their mark on the development of <a href=\"/art/rock-music\">rock music</a>.","The postwar era of the 1950s was also a time of prosperity and major achievement for Australian sports. Many sports competitions had been canceled during the war, and, with <a href=\"/topic/large-numbers-1765137\">large numbers</a> of Australians fighting abroad, sports participation also dwindled. Immediately following the end of the war, Australians had more leisure time, and their passion for sports was reignited. Indeed, the postwar era from 1946 to 1966 became the “golden era” for sports in Australia.

The U.S. alliance crystallized in the 1951 Australia–<a href=\"/place/New-Zealand\">New Zealand</a>–United States (<a href=\"/event/ANZUS-Pact\">ANZUS</a>) Pact, reinforced (1955–77) by the <a href=\"/topic/Southeast-Asia-Treaty-Organization\">Southeast Asia Treaty Organization</a> (SEATO).

Traditionally Labor had been suspicious of mass <a href=\"/topic/immigration\">immigration</a>, seeing it as a threat to established <a href=\"/topic/wage\">wages</a> and standards. Yet in 1946 the ALP government initiated a policy that assisted the entry not only of people from the United Kingdom but also of many others from war-distressed <a href=\"/place/Europe\">Europe</a>. The peak year of net immigration (about 150,000) was 1950, while the greatest numbers of assisted migrants (about 100,000 per annum) came in the later 1960s. While it has been modified many times, this overall policy has remained in place. Closer ties with Australia’s Asian neighbours, however, moved toward abandoning the policy of virtual exclusion of “coloured” immigrants. From the late 1960s such restrictions were eased.

The estimated number of persons of Aboriginal descent had risen from a nadir of 73,828 in 1933 to more than 170,000 in the early 1980s; in 1962, Aboriginal people received the franchise and, for the first time, were to be counted in the national census. Aboriginal claims moved from wage equality with Europeans to land rights over territory with Aboriginal associations. The South Australian government acted in this direction from 1966, and the federal Aboriginal Land Rights Act (1976), applying to the Northern Territory, was particularly important. In 1967 the general electorate overwhelmingly supported a constitutional <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amendment\">amendment</a> to increase Commonwealth powers in Aboriginal matters. Equality in formal civic rights, wage payments, and social welfare benefits became the norm. Some groups received considerable royalties from mining activities on their land.","The Whitlam government in particular encouraged a variety of ethnic organizations, most importantly the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee (founded in 1973, from 1977 renamed the National Aboriginal Conference). These organizations contributed to a growing strength and pride in Aboriginality. Early in the period, Aboriginal persons became known for their contributions to sport (boxer <a href=\"/biography/Lionel-Rose\">Lionel Rose</a>, tennis player <a href=\"/biography/Evonne-Goolagong-Cawley\">Evonne Goolagong Cawley</a>).

School curricula began to provide sympathetic teaching of Aboriginal culture to all Australians. Such policies reinforced a shift away from assimilationist ideas. This shift applied nationwide but had particular relevance in sustaining the surviving remnants of tribal life. In the late 20th century the number of Aboriginal persons with some experience of traditional Aboriginal life was estimated to be about 10,000.","Increased awareness of past depredations against Aboriginal peoples helped shape a wider-ranging <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/critique\">critique</a> of the Australian experience. Dissidents influenced by the New Marxism of the later 1960s (notably Humphrey McQueen in his <em>A New Britannia</em>, first published in 1970) saw the nation as ever dominated by petty bourgeois standards—mean, acquisitive, racist, and authoritarian. Many earlier commentators had perceived such traits, but now they were attacked with more fundamental repugnance. The dismissal of Whitlam in 1975 encouraged the belief that essentially Australia was not a democracy and that it suffered much from a heritage of subservience to <a href=\"/place/British-Empire\">British</a> imperial standards. While this radical critique lost some acerbity after 1980, it left an impression, especially on the liberal intelligentsia.

The arrival and presence of over 100,000  U.S. troops in Australia from 1941 had a substantial impact on postwar culture and society. The American alliance with Australia during the war forged close ties between the two countries, and Australia came to depend on the United States for military support as well as economic growth. Prior to the war, Australian society had been largely influenced by conservative British culture, mirroring its entertainment, music, and sports as well as its social attitudes. By the end of the war a significant change was underway, however, and from the 1950s onward Australian lifestyles felt the dramatic impact of the new more rebellious culture of the United States, which had emerged from the war in a powerful economic position.","The strong cultural influence that the United States exerted over other Western countries, especially Australia, was profound. Because Australia also experienced an economic boom as a result of the war, its newfound affluent position enabled Australians to embrace innovative new and now more-affordable products and technologies, many of which were imported from the more industrialized United States. American ideals and cultural products, such as film and music, quickly dispersed throughout Australian society, with an accompanying move away from the traditional restricted ways of prewar life to a more liberated and expressive lifestyle.","Film-going had become one of the most popular pastimes for Australian people during World War II, as motion pictures provided a form of escapism from the horrors of the real wartime world. In 1945 alone, 151 million cinema admissions were recorded in Australia. Most of the films shown on Australian screens between the 1940s and ’50s, however, were produced by American companies. Australian-made films were in very short supply in the early 1950s. Many of the American films appealed to a teenage audience with their depiction of radical American social themes and ideals. This exposure undoubtedly had an impact upon impressionable adolescents, sparking the birth of a new youth culture in Australia.","The introduction of <a href=\"/topic/television-broadcasting\">television</a> in Australia in September 1956 provided a new cultural experience and resulted in a dramatic decline in cinema attendance. Television quickly became one of the most popular forms of entertainment and one of the most influential mediums in the country. The Australian government had been determined to have the country’s first television network up and running in time for the Melbourne Olympic Games, and it met this objective with some two months to spare.","In the initial years after television’s arrival, not many Australians could afford the new technology.  However, as televisions became less expensive, the number of Australians who owned a television rapidly increased. Despite the enormous popularity of television, a small proportion of society opposed it, mainly because the majority of programs were American productions. With more than 80 percent of television content sourced from the United States, it was feared that American content, themes, and culture would impede the development of the Australian identity. This concern was <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alleviated\">alleviated</a> somewhat when the demand for an increase in Australian content led to the broadcasting of more Australian programs in the mid-1960s, particularly Australian dramatic series.","The proliferation of vinyl records after World War II had a major impact on the experience of music in Australia and revolutionized the music industry. By the early 1960s more than 500,000 records were being manufactured every month in Australia. This spike in record production coincided with the explosion of rebellious youth-oriented culture, sparked by the rise of <a href=\"/art/rock-and-roll-early-style-of-rock-music\">rock and roll</a>, the arrival of which in Australia is usually dated to the theatrical release in 1955 of <a href=\"/topic/Blackboard-Jungle\"></a>; the movie featured the hit single “Rock Around the Clock” by the American band <a href=\"/biography/Bill-Haley\">Bill Haley</a> and <a href=\"/topic/Bill-Haley-and-His-Comets\">His Comets</a>, whose Australian tour in 1957 was a sensation. Johnny O’Keefe became the first Australian rock singer to reach the national charts with the release of his hit “Wild One” in 1958. With the exciting new music came the creation of expressive new dance styles and trendy youthful clothing. Put off by the accompanying changes in behaviour, fashion, and attitudes, some in the older generation blamed rock and roll for the rise in <a href=\"/topic/delinquency\">juvenile delinquency</a>. But new music had come to stay, and in the successive decades many Australians would put their mark on the development of <a href=\"/art/rock-music\">rock music</a>.","The postwar era of the 1950s was also a time of prosperity and major achievement for Australian sports. Many sports competitions had been canceled during the war, and, with <a href=\"/topic/large-numbers-1765137\">large numbers</a> of Australians fighting abroad, sports participation also dwindled. Immediately following the end of the war, Australians had more leisure time, and their passion for sports was reignited. Indeed, the postwar era from 1946 to 1966 became the “golden era” for sports in Australia. The broadcasting on television of the <a href=\"/event/Melbourne-1956-Olympic-Games\">Melbourne Olympic Games</a> helped unite Australians in sense of pride at the success of their athletes in the first Australian-hosted Games.

The U.S. alliance crystallized in the 1951 Australia–<a href=\"/place/New-Zealand\">New Zealand</a>–United States (<a href=\"/event/ANZUS-Pact\">ANZUS</a>) Pact, reinforced (1955–77) by the <a href=\"/topic/Southeast-Asia-Treaty-Organization\">Southeast Asia Treaty Organization</a> (SEATO).

Traditionally Labor had been suspicious of mass <a href=\"/topic/immigration\">immigration</a>, seeing it as a threat to established <a href=\"/topic/wage\">wages</a> and standards. Yet in 1946 the ALP government initiated a policy that assisted the entry not only of people from the United Kingdom but also of many others from war-distressed <a href=\"/place/Europe\">Europe</a>. The peak year of net immigration (about 150,000) was 1950, while the greatest numbers of assisted migrants (about 100,000 per annum) came in the later 1960s. While it has been modified many times, this overall policy has remained in place. Closer ties with Australia’s Asian neighbours, however, moved toward abandoning the policy of virtual exclusion of “coloured” immigrants. From the late 1960s such restrictions were eased.

The estimated number of persons of Aboriginal descent had risen from a nadir of 73,828 in 1933 to more than 170,000 in the early 1980s; in 1962, Aboriginal people received the franchise and, for the first time, were to be counted in the national census. Aboriginal claims moved from wage equality with Europeans to land rights over territory with Aboriginal associations. The South Australian government acted in this direction from 1966, and the federal Aboriginal Land Rights Act (1976), applying to the Northern Territory, was particularly important. In 1967 the general electorate overwhelmingly supported a constitutional <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amendment\">amendment</a> to increase Commonwealth powers in Aboriginal matters. Equality in formal civic rights, wage payments, and social welfare benefits became the norm. Some groups received considerable royalties from mining activities on their land.","The Whitlam government in particular encouraged a variety of ethnic organizations, most importantly the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee (founded in 1973, from 1977 renamed the National Aboriginal Conference). These organizations contributed to a growing strength and pride in Aboriginality. Early in the period, Aboriginal persons became known for their contributions to sport (boxer <a href=\"/biography/Lionel-Rose\">Lionel Rose</a>, tennis player <a href=\"/biography/Evonne-Goolagong-Cawley\">Evonne Goolagong Cawley</a>).

School curricula began to provide sympathetic teaching of Aboriginal culture to all Australians. Such policies reinforced a shift away from assimilationist ideas. This shift applied nationwide but had particular relevance in sustaining the surviving remnants of tribal life. In the late 20th century the number of Aboriginal persons with some experience of traditional Aboriginal life was estimated to be about 10,000.","Increased awareness of past depredations against Aboriginal peoples helped shape a wider-ranging <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/critique\">critique</a> of the Australian experience. Dissidents influenced by the New Marxism of the later 1960s (notably Humphrey McQueen in his <em>A New Britannia</em>, first published in 1970) saw the nation as ever dominated by petty bourgeois standards—mean, acquisitive, racist, and authoritarian. Many earlier commentators had perceived such traits, but now they were attacked with more fundamental repugnance. The dismissal of Whitlam in 1975 encouraged the belief that essentially Australia was not a democracy and that it suffered much from a heritage of subservience to <a href=\"/place/British-Empire\">British</a> imperial standards. While this radical critique lost some acerbity after 1980, it left an impression, especially on the liberal intelligentsia.

The landmasses reassembled to form Pangaea between the late Carboniferous (about 315 million years ago) and the Late Jurassic (150 million years ago), after which they began (and have continued) to disperse again. Attending the clustering of the continents in Pangaea were the tectonic effect of reduced turnover of mantle material and the environmental effects of low global sea level, a low concentration of atmospheric <a href=\"/science/carbon-dioxide\">carbon dioxide</a>, and, through the correspondingly weak <a href=\"/science/greenhouse-effect\">greenhouse effect</a>, low retention of heat from the Sun.

In the Kimberleys and the Mueller Range there are extensive outcrops of flat-lying massive sandstone that have been dissected to give rise to striking isolated rock features known variously as plateaus, mesas, and buttes. Under those circumstances, local joints and bedding planes in the rocks, combined with the permeable nature of the bedrock, control the local landforms. Similar plateau forms dominate the <a href=\"/place/Pilbara\">Pilbara</a> and <a href=\"/place/Arnhem-Land\">Arnhem Land</a>, though in the former region horizontally bedded or only gently warped massive ironstone formations, together with massive sandstones, give rise to prominent bluffs bordering the plateau assemblages; and in the latter karst landforms (greatly eroded) are developed where limestone occurs at the surface. At the margins of the Kimberleys (in the Fitzroy region and in the Durack Range) and in the southern part of the Pilbara, in the Ophthalmia Range, dipping rock strata have been differentially eroded to form ridges and valleys. Such features are also extensively and well developed in the uplands of central Australia (the <a href=\"/place/MacDonnell-Ranges\">MacDonnell</a>, James, and Krichauff ranges), in the Isa Highlands, and in the <a href=\"/place/Stirling-Range\">Stirling Range</a> of the southwest. In all those areas it is the sandstones and quartzites that underlie the upstanding ridges, the intervening valleys being eroded in siltstones or shales, and in all those areas the pattern in plan of ridge and valley reflects the pattern of folding in the underlying rocks.","In the far southwest, the <a href=\"/place/Darling-Range\">Darling Range</a> forms an upfaulted block underlain mainly by granite but capped by laterite, a reddish, <a href=\"/science/iron-chemical-element\">iron</a>-rich product of weathering rock. The Gawler block, in the southeast, is complex.

The so-called <a href=\"/place/Barkly-Tableland\">Barkly Tableland</a> is in reality a high plain of remarkable flatness, partly eroded in <a href=\"/science/Cambrian-Period\">Cambrian</a> sedimentary rocks (those about 485 to 541 million years old) and partly underlain by swamp deposits of <a href=\"/science/Neogene-Period\">Neogene</a> and <a href=\"/science/Paleogene-Period\">Paleogene</a> age (i.e., about 2.6 to 66 million years old). The Nullarbor Plain, a karst area, is approximately coincident with the <a href=\"/place/Eucla-Basin\">Eucla Basin</a>. Its surface is so flat that in one section the Trans-Australian Railway runs absolutely straight for some 300 miles (500 km) as it passes over the region. A vast area of the southwest of <a href=\"/place/Western-Australia\">Western Australia</a> is occupied by an extensive high plain traversed by elongate ribbons encrusted with salt, the desiccated and disrupted remnants of former river courses. The <a href=\"/place/Gibson-Desert\">Gibson Desert</a> consists in large part of a laterite-capped plain, but huge areas of the plains of central and northern Australia are occupied by active sand dunes, and large areas of southern South Australia and Western Australia are covered by fields of fixed dunes.","Actively developing and moving sand ridges occupy the <a href=\"/place/Canning-Basin\">Canning Basin</a>, the <a href=\"/place/Great-Victoria-Desert\">Great Victoria Desert</a>, the Amadeus depression, and large areas of the Arunta-Sturt Complex. The dune fields extend to the east into the <a href=\"/place/Great-Artesian-Basin\">Great Artesian Basin</a>, where the dunes <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constitute\">constitute</a> the well-known <a href=\"/place/Simpson-Desert\">Simpson Desert</a>. Those dune deserts reflect the prevailing aridity of most of Australia, and the dune trend displays a huge swirl around the centre of the continent. Yet, even in the most arid areas, rain falls from time to time, and the rivers run occasionally. Because of the scarcity of vegetation and the common development of impermeable rock layers of various types, runoff in the arid lands tends to be rapid and achieves dramatic and significant results. Hillslopes are scoured and washed bare of weathered debris; streams erode gullies and transport large volumes of sediment from the uplands to the plains; broad, braided river channels are developed; and extensive alluvial plains are formed. It is the alluvium, carried to the lowlands by rivers and deposited on the plains, that is, in large measure, the source of the sand out of which the desert dunes are molded by the wind.","In the far southwest of the shield, and especially in the northern areas, precipitation is sufficient to support a considerable vegetation and is regular enough for streams to flow seasonally. There the work of rivers in shaping the land surface is more obvious and widespread; the landscape consists essentially of valleys and intervening divides, the precise form of each depending on local structure. But in such areas the rate of landscape change is more rapid than in the arid zones.","Many of the landforms of the shield are inherited from the past, when different climatic conditions obtained. Remnants of laterite are widespread in many parts of Australia: the <a href=\"/place/Darling-Range\">Darling Range,</a> the far southwest, the Isa Highlands, and Mueller Range, near Darwin, and the southern <a href=\"/place/Eyre-Peninsula\">Eyre Peninsula</a>. The evidence indicates that during the Paleogene and Neogene periods those areas had been reduced to low relief, and humid tropical climates prevailed, for laterite is at present forming only under such conditions in such areas as <a href=\"/place/Southeast-Asia\">Southeast Asia</a> and the <a href=\"/place/Congo-River\">Congo River</a> basin. The disrupted former drainage system of southwest Western Australia has already been referred to, and remnants of similar old stream networks occur in the Amadeus depression, on the <a href=\"/place/Nullarbor-Plain\">Nullarbor Plain</a>, and in the <a href=\"/place/Great-Victoria-Desert\">Great Victoria Desert</a>.

But in the south the occurrence of dunes now fixed by vegetation shows that the climate there has recently become moister.","Finally, in several parts of the shield remnants of eroded surfaces, planed off and covered with hard, silicified crusts of weathered rock, cut across local bedrock and are either preserved high in the relief or buried beneath later sedimentary deposits. They attest to changes in the disposition of the land surface (either base-level changes or regional warping or faulting) and also indicate that, in the past, surfaces of low relief similar to present ones were widely developed. Reference has already been made to the distribution of the laterite surface. At the eastern margin of the shield there are remnants of a still older surface, of middle or late <a href=\"/science/Mesozoic-Era\">Mesozoic</a> age (i.e., formed about 175 to 66 million years ago), which has been warped by subsequent earth movements and now disappears beneath the sediments of the Great Artesian and similar basins. Other evidence of the existence of that surface has been found in northwestern Queensland, central Australia, and South Australia.","On the southeastern extremity of the shield, the <a href=\"/place/Flinders-Ranges\">Flinders</a>–Mount Lofty ranges occupy the site of the Adelaide downwarp in the Earth’s surface. The sediments were folded and faulted, principally in the early Paleozoic (about 540 million years ago), though recurrently since. The <a href=\"/place/Flinders-Ranges\">Flinders Ranges</a> are a much-eroded fold mountain belt characterized by ridge and valley forms in which sandstone ridges and bluffs are dominant. The Willochra Plain occupies an elongate intermontane basin excavated from a major upwarped structure and achieved through the <a href=\"/science/erosion-geology\">erosion</a> of some 20,000 feet (6,000 metres) of sediments. There are remnants of old land surfaces of low relief, and, in the north, extremely rugged relief developed on a much-shattered granite outcrop.","To the south, the <a href=\"/place/Mount-Lofty-Ranges\">Mount Lofty Range</a> is a faulted and much dissected and complex horst, or ancient uplifted structural block. Bounded on both east and west by meridional or gently arcuate fault scarps, which developed initially in the Early Paleozoic but which have suffered recurrent movements since (and which indeed are still active), the ranges are surmounted in many areas by the remnants of a lateritic plain. In many other areas, such a hard capping of rock, if ever present, has been eliminated by stream erosion. Sandstones again form prominent ridges and residuals (isolated relief features), such as Mount Lofty itself; small granite outcrops give rise to boulder-strewn surfaces; and exposures of gneiss form slablike blocks known as tombstones, monk stones, or penitent rocks.","Between the Mount Lofty and the Flinders ranges is a region of broad simple folds in which the sandstone ridges run for the most part north-south and in which the broad open valleys were in some instances occupied by lakes during the Paleogene and Neogene periods. To the northeast, similar upland areas of low relief, but with domes of <a href=\"/science/crystalline-rock\">crystalline rock</a> standing above the general level, dominate the Olary Spur."],"sections":[],"isFilled":true},{"level":3,"id":"ref44999","sidebarHeader":"The Interior Lowlands","header":"The Interior Lowlands","paragraphs":["The <a href=\"/place/Interior-Lowlands-region-North-America\">Interior Lowlands</a> are dominated by three major basins, the Carpentaria Basin, the <a href=\"/place/Eyre-Basin\">Eyre Basin</a>, and the Murray Basin.

The Wilcannia <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/threshold\">threshold</a> divides the Eyre and Murray basins, and the latter is separated from the Otway Basin and the Southern Ocean by the Padthaway Ridge. The Eyre and Murray basins are entirely terrestrial, but the Carpentaria is partly inundated by the sea.","The Carpentaria plains, occupying the basin of the same name, form a narrow lowland corridor between the Isa Highlands and the Einasleigh uplands (part of the Eastern Uplands). They are drained by the Leichhardt, Flinders, and Gilbert rivers and in the south take the form of broadly rolling plains underlain by heavy gray lime-enriched (pedocalic) soils. In the north, however, there are extensive flat depositional plains, some of them related to swamps from the <a href=\"/science/Pleistocene-Epoch\">Pleistocene Epoch</a> (i.e., about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago), some associated with the present floodplains of the braided river systems. Standing above the plains, for example around Normanton, are considerable plateau and mesa remnants of the Paleogene and Neogene laterite surface.","Similar rolling plains with laterite residuals standing above them occur in the Eyre Basin, particularly around the headwaters of the <a href=\"/place/Diamantina-River\">Diamantina</a>, near Kynuna. But to the south, toward the more arid interior, the plains become flatter and are protected by a veneer of stones—the well-known stony desert with its mantle of gibber (hammada, serir, and desert armour). In many parts of southwestern Queensland, northeastern South Australia, and northwestern New South Wales, there are plateau and related relief remnants similar to those found in other parts of the lowlands, although those are capped and protected not by laterite but by silcrete, another hard rock residue. That region is folded in places, and the subsequent dissection by erosive forces has brought about disintegration of the silcrete, which is about 20 million years old and which formerly extended over vast areas of central Australia. That process provided much stony debris for the gibber plains so characteristic of much of central Australia and particularly of the <a href=\"/place/Lake-Eyre\">Lake Eyre</a> depression.","The <a href=\"/science/drainage-basin\">catchment area</a> of Lake Eyre extends over some 500,000 square miles (1,295,000 square km) of central and northern Australia. It occupies the lowest point of the Australian continent (about 50 feet [15 metres] below sea level), and many large river systems drain into it. The rivers drain the driest part of the continent. But no desert is rainless, and floodwaters entirely cover the bed of Lake Eyre about twice each century, the waters deriving not only from central Australia but also from the higher-rainfall areas drained by the headwaters of the Georgina, Diamantina, Thomson, Barcoo, and similar rivers. It is now clear that, during the late Pleistocene, the precipitation of central Australia was heavier than it is now. The interior drainage basin has received vast quantities of sediment and salt by those rivers, past and present. That has provided ample source material for the Simpson Desert dunes, and many of the normally <a href=\"/science/playa\">dry lake</a> beds, including all the large ones, are encrusted with salt. Most of the largest salinas, or salt pans (Eyre, Frome, Torrens, Gregory, and Blanche), are, at least in part, of structural origin, having been formed by downfaulted blocks. Torrens and Gregory are surfaced mainly by gypsum, but the remainder carry a crust of <a href=\"/science/salt\">sodium chloride</a>, common salt. Around the major salinas there are extensive alluvial plains.","Under the prevailing arid conditions, fine dust is winnowed from the surface sediments and can be carried high into the air in dust storms. Some is carried long distances, even reaching New Zealand from time to time. The sand of the alluvium is molded into dune ridges.","<a href=\"/science/sand-dune\">Sand dunes</a> also occupy large areas of the Murray River basin. They are, by contrast, fixed (or “fossil”) dunes, which developed at some time in the recent past and have since been stabilized by higher precipitation conditions. The eastern part of the basin, near the foothills of the Eastern Uplands, shows evidence of those former higher precipitation amounts in the numerous abandoned river channels of the <a href=\"/place/Riverina\">Riverina</a>. But the western Murray plains are a stony as well as a climatic desert. The plains are underlain by limestones of Miocene age (those about 23 to 5.3 million years old) and, in many areas, by calcrete, a calcareous soil accumulation. Instances of water-dissolved sinkholes and enclosed depressions can be found, and there is a lack of surface drainage characteristic of that type of topography. Only the Murray River, which originates outside the area in a different <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environment\">environment</a>, crosses the basin, flowing in a narrow trench in its lower reaches.","In the east of that region there are extensive alluvial plains associated with major tributaries of the Murray.

The uplands are the eroded remnants of an ancient mountain range recently rejuvenated by block faulting.

Granite batholiths were intruded into that region, and during the <a href=\"/science/Cenozoic-Era\">Cenozoic Era</a> (the past 66 million years) <a href=\"/science/lava-volcanic-ejecta\">lavas</a> appeared extensively in areas as far apart as northern Queensland and Tasmania.

Uplifted structural blocks, many of them trending north to south, are common in some areas, while straight river courses reflect the control exercised by fault zones.

Massive domes or clusters of boulders are common on the exposed granitic batholiths.

Over some two-thirds of its landmass, precipitation (largely as rainfall) per annum averages less than 20 inches (500 mm), and over one-third of it is less than 10 inches (250 mm). Little more than one-tenth of the continent receives more than 40 inches (1,000 mm) per year. As has been noted, in winter the snowfields of Tasmania and the Mount Kosciuszko area can be extensive, but on the whole Australia is an extremely hot country, in consequence of which evaporation losses are high and the effectiveness of the rainfall received is reduced. In addition, the severity of climate, the predominance of the outdoors in the minds and lives of many, and the national importance of agricultural and pastoral pursuits all make Australians perhaps more climate-conscious than most. In no country of comparable development do climate and weather loom so large in the lives and conversation of the people.","The principal features of Australia’s climate stem from its position, shape, and size. Australia is mainly a compact tropical and near-tropical continent. No major arms or embayments of the sea penetrate far into the landmass. The only extensive uplands occur near the east coast, and even they are not, by world standards, very high.","In summer (December–February), when the sun is directly overhead in northern Australia, temperatures are extremely high. The sea exerts little moderating influence, and the uplands are not sufficiently extensive or high to have more than local effects. Temperatures commonly soar above the 100 °F (38 °C) mark in the interior, but because there rarely is any cloud cover, radiation loss is considerable at night, and daily temperature ranges are wide. High temperatures dominate the Australian summers in all but Tasmania. Heat waves are common, and, though the highest amounts of <a href=\"/science/solar-radiation\">solar radiation</a> are received in northern South Australia, the highest temperatures and longest heat waves are recorded in the northwest of Western Australia. For example, <a href=\"/place/Marble-Bar\">Marble Bar</a> has recorded a maximum temperature of 100 °F or more on 162 consecutive days. Temperatures in winter remain moderate except in the uplands of Tasmania and southeastern Australia, where snow is common. Night frosts are common in winter throughout southern Australia and in the interior.","Because of its relatively low latitudinal position, Australia comes under the influence of the southeast trade winds in the north and the westerlies in the south. Northern Australia is affected by a northerly <a href=\"/science/monsoon\">monsoon</a>, partly because of the <a href=\"/science/latitude\">latitude</a> and the seasonal migration of planetary wind zones and partly because of the summer heating of the continental interior that draws in surface winds. The monsoon brings summer (December–February) rains to the northern coastal area that penetrate inland for variable distances. The summer rains are all the more important because most of northern Australia is in the sheltered <a href=\"/science/rain-shadow\">rain shadow</a> of the Eastern Uplands, which block the rain-bearing southeast <a href=\"/science/trade-wind\">trades</a> in winter. The trades, forced to rise by the uplands, bring heavy rains to the Pacific coasts of Queensland and northern New South Wales. Those areas are also affected by tropical cyclones and receive the heaviest rains of any part of Australia. Within the coastal fringe, the northern Queensland area around Tully, south of <a href=\"/place/Cairns\">Cairns</a>, is the wettest, with an annual average of nearly 160 inches (4,050 mm).","Southern Australia receives winter rains from depressions associated with the west-wind zone. Again, there are local topographic controls, with uplands receiving higher amounts than the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adjacent\">adjacent</a> plains. Parts of the southern <a href=\"/place/Mount-Lofty-Ranges\">Mount Lofty Range</a>, in South Australia, average more than 40 inches (1,000 mm) of rainfall per year, but <a href=\"/place/Adelaide-Range\">Adelaide</a>, to the west, averages only about 20 inches (500 mm), while the Murray plains, in the rain shadows of the range, receive 15 inches (380 mm) or less rainfall annually.","In the great mass of the interior of Australia, annual rainfall averages less than 20 inches (500 mm), and over vast areas the total is less than 10 inches (250 mm); the Lake <a href=\"/place/Eyre-Basin\">Eyre</a> region averages less than half that amount. Rainfall in those areas is unreliable and <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capricious\">capricious</a>, with long droughts broken by damaging rains and floods. Over Australia as a whole, rainfall is indeed extremely variable. Only in the far north, around Darwin, in the southwest of Western Australia, in southern South Australia and Victoria, in Tasmania, and in eastern New South Wales is the recorded annual precipitation fairly consistent, in any given year totaling no more than 10 percent above or below the long-term average in specific years.","Much of Australia’s marked climatic variability has been ascribed to the changeability in differential air pressures over the central Pacific and the Indonesian archipelago, primarily caused by contrasts in sea and ocean temperatures. The resulting large-scale swing in air pressure is known as the Southern Oscillation. Monitoring the <a href=\"/science/Southern-Oscillation-Index\">Southern Oscillation Index</a> (SOI) is now considered essential to seasonal <a href=\"/science/weather-forecasting\">weather forecasting</a>. The SOI is strongly negative when weak Pacific winds bring less moisture than usual to Australia. Prolonged negative phases are related to <a href=\"/science/El-Nino\">El Niño</a> episodes in the South Pacific, and most of Australia’s major droughts have been related to those episodes.

The vast central and northern regions too arid for the cultivation of crops were stocked with millions of sheep and cattle, converting them to rangelands.

The principal aim of the strategy was to ensure that the frogs survived in the wild by collecting eggs from their natural habitat and by increasing the number of eggs laid in captivity.","The federal and state governments partnered with organizations and landowners to help protect biodiversity “hotspots.” By 2017 the government had identified 15 of these large regions with a high <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diversity\">diversity</a> of native species that are not found, or are only rarely found, anywhere else in the world.

The number of general popular books dealing with the ornamental, horticultural, medicinal, culinary, and other uses of plants increased sharply following the publication of a major new flora, the multivolume series <em>Flora of Australia</em> (1981– ).","Australia’s phanerogamian (seed plant) <a href=\"/topic/Flora-Roman-mythology\">flora</a> of approximately 20,000 species is thought to have arisen in ancient times from two distinct intakes of stock. Both stocks had previously been involved in a wider theatre, and each intake was followed by a period when the species adapted and diversified within the continent. The great advances in geophysics toward understanding continental drift have made it possible to take the paleontological and related botanical evidence and reconstruct the physical environment and time-sequence.","Australia’s initial intake of flora originated—as was the case with present-day <a href=\"/place/South-America\">South America</a>, <a href=\"/place/Africa\">Africa</a>, <a href=\"/place/India\">India</a>, <a href=\"/place/Madagascar\">Madagascar</a>, <a href=\"/place/New-Caledonia-French-unique-collectivity-Pacific-Ocean\">New Caledonia</a>, <a href=\"/place/New-Zealand\">New Zealand</a>, and <a href=\"/place/Antarctica\">Antarctica</a>—during the period when it was part of <a href=\"/place/Gondwana-historical-region-India\">Gondwana</a>.

Those are comparatively recent arrivals from the north.","The characteristic part of Australia’s plant life that is little shared with other lands, together with those specialized characteristics that apparently originated on the continent long ago, form what has been designated as an Australian (or autochthonous) element. It includes many of the plants that are distinctive to typical Australian vegetation scenery and shows a marked tendency to sclerophylly (formation of hard leaves).

There is no standard, or worldwide, classification system (such as exists for describing flora) for that aspect of the environment. Initial attempts to apply European and American classification concepts to Australia were not particularly satisfactory, because of the peculiarities of the continent’s vegetation and environment. For example, climatic control of local vegetation zones was often found insufficient to explain vegetation changes; on the contrary, soil patterns and geologic history quite override climatic control in many localities. Similarly, structural descriptive schemes useful for Northern Hemisphere coniferous and deciduous vegetation proved inappropriate when confronted by the great variety of evergreen vegetation—notably mallees and shrubs—found in Australia. The mapping of Australian vegetation is based largely on factual descriptive features, and by that means <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/comprehensive\">comprehensive</a> and detailed accounts and maps have been produced.","Australian plant life is distributed in three main zones—the Tropical, Temperate, and Eremian—a pattern that reflects overall climatic conditions. The <a href=\"/science/tropical-zone\">Tropical Zone</a>, which arcs east and west across the northern margin of the <a href=\"/science/continent\">continent</a> and extends halfway down the eastern seaboard, has a mainly dry monsoonal climate, with some wet regions.

The Eremian Zone covers the whole of central Australia through to the west-central coast; its climate is arid.","The major structural units <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constituting\">constituting</a> the geographic distribution are rainforest, sclerophyll forest (dominated by hard-leaved plants such as eucalypts), and woodland, scrub, savanna, and grassland forms, each with a range of subforms. The bulk of the Tropical Zone <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/comprises\">comprises</a> mixed deciduous woodland and sclerophyllous low-tree savanna, with areas of tussock grassland, coastal mangrove complexes, and <a href=\"/science/tropical-rainforest\">tropical rainforest</a> containing much exotic vegetation—particularly in the northeastern parts of Cape York Peninsula and in Queensland. A strong Malesian influence occurs throughout the entire zone. The rainforests—characterized by large trees with stem buttresses and by multiple vegetation layers with interlaced canopies of <a href=\"/plant/liana\">lianas</a> and <a href=\"/plant/epiphyte\">epiphytes</a> growing in the trees—fit the popular concept of “jungle.”","The Temperate Zone is characterized by dry and wet sclerophyllous forests, temperate mixed woodlands, savanna woodlands, mallees, and scrubs, with areas of alpine vegetational complexes, temperate rainforest, and sclerophyllous heath. A much higher proportion of the vegetation cover is typically and recognizably “Australian.” Within that zone the southwestern corner of Western Australia is outstanding, both for the high proportion of Australian plants and for the richness of the plant life, while the vegetation of Tasmania is notable for its forests of southern beech and for its botanical links with New Zealand and South America. In marked contrast to the tropical rainforests, the predominant trees throughout most of the Temperate Zone <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/communities\">communities</a> are either <em>Eucalyptus</em> or <em>Acacia</em>.

Many shrubs have adapted themselves similarly to the arid conditions, so that in their vegetative state many representatives of different families look alike. <em>Acacia</em>, <em>Eremophila</em>, and <em>Casuarina</em> are examples of genera that tend to displace <em>Eucalyptus</em> as the dominant tree or shrub.

Australia probably has between 200,000 and 300,000 species, about 100,000 of which have been described. There are some 250 species of native mammals, 550 species of land and aquatic birds, 680 species of reptiles, 190 species of frogs, and more than 2,000 species of marine and freshwater fish. The remainder are invertebrates, including insects.","In the varied environments of the Tropical Zone, species confined to the rainforests of the mountainous northeast include the tree <a href=\"/animal/kangaroo\">kangaroos</a> (genus <em>Dendrolagus</em>) and the gorgeous bird-wing butterflies (<em>Ornithoptera</em>). Others favour more open habitats such as savannas and grasslands. Among that group are the agile <a href=\"/animal/wallaby\">wallaby</a> (<em>Macropus agilis</em>) and <em>Amitermes meridionalis</em>, a termite that orients its mounds in a north-south direction by sensing <a href=\"/science/geomagnetic-field\">Earth’s magnetic field</a>.","The animals of the Eremian Zone are characterized by their ability to survive under extremely arid conditions and irregular rainfall.

They include the galah (<em>Cacatua roseicapilla</em>; a species of cockatoo) and the Australian magpie (<em>Gymnorhina tibicen</em>).","Extinction of native species is a matter of much concern. Some 20 mammal, 20 bird, and 70 <a href=\"/plant/angiosperm\">flowering plant</a> species are presumed to have become extinct during the period of European settlement. Some 50 terrestrial mammals and more than 1,000 flowering plants are officially listed as both <a href=\"/science/endangered-species\">endangered</a> or vulnerable; that description is also applied to about 30 amphibians, 50 reptiles, and 50 birds. Estimates of the numbers of introduced species include 1,500 to 2,000 flowering plants, 30 freshwater and marine fish, and about 70 land animals and birds. There has also been a great reduction of range of most species inhabiting temperate or semiarid lands, except for those that have benefited from the extension of pastures and watering points. The latter species include the large kangaroos and the Australian magpie.","The high <a href=\"/topic/degree-education\">degree</a> to which many species depend on a relatively narrow range of vegetation types means that animals of some zones have suffered more from human activity than others. Small and medium-size terrestrial mammals and ground-nesting birds of temperate and semiarid grasslands and shrublands have been most affected by clearing for pastures and cereal crops. In addition, they have suffered most from competition with and habitat destruction by introduced animals such as rabbits, sheep, goats, and cattle and from predation by the foxes and feral cats. Few parts of Australia are free from the effects of introduced animal species. In the tropical north the cane toad (<em>Bufo marinus</em>) is believed to be a major predator of small native vertebrates. Even the introduced honeybee, which is widely established in the feral state, is suspected of affecting native nectar-feeding insects, mammals, and birds.","The role of <a href=\"/topic/Australian-Aboriginal\">Aboriginal</a> people in causing the extinction of fauna before European settlement has been much debated. It is clear that at the time of European settlement Aboriginal hunting and burning had major effects on animal numbers, but a balance seems to have been maintained, possibly assisted by a system of social prohibitions that protected important species under certain conditions. But the effect of the initial Aboriginal entry on the continent is not yet clear. At that time, at least 60,000 years ago, the fauna contained many species of large animals (the Australian megafauna) and was considerably different from the fauna present at the time of European settlement. Such megafaunal animals as the rhinoceros-sized <em>Diprotodon</em>, giant wombats, the giant short-faced kangaroos (<em>Sthenurus</em> and <em>Procoptodon</em>), the so-called <a href=\"/animal/marsupial\">marsupial</a> lion <em>Thylacoleo</em>, and giant flightless birds called mihirungs or <em>Genyornis</em> probably became extinct over a period between 27,000 and 12,000 years ago, possibly as late as 6,000 years ago.","It has been argued that Aboriginal overhunting, together with environmental changes caused by associated Aboriginal burning of the country, caused the extinction of those species. Others have suggested that climatic fluctuations at the end of the Pleistocene (some 11,700 years ago) were a more likely cause. Certainly, although there were no extensive ice sheets in Australia, the last glacial maximum (between 22,000 and 18,000 years ago) was a time of highly arid, as well as cold and windy, conditions. Deserts reached their greatest extent at that time, and there is no doubt that under such conditions the fauna (as well as humans) would have been under considerable physiological stress. No clear <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consensus\">consensus</a> has emerged, and, in view of the facts that there is no evidence of a sudden mass extinction and that Aboriginal people seem to have occupied most of Australia for at least 20,000 years before the last megafauna disappeared, it is likely that a combination of all those factors played a part. By about 20,000 years ago, few mammals had survived that weighed more than their human predators.","Commercial hunting of only a few species of native fauna is allowed. It is confined to several species of the kangaroo family, muttonbirds (<em>Puffinus tenuirostris</em>), and some of the most common cockatoos and parrots; however, federal law does not permit live birds to be exported. Permits can be obtained to destroy pest species (such as kangaroos in certain circumstances). Sport shooting of game birds (ducks, quail, and snipes) and a few mammals is permitted in some states. Before controls were established, the numbers of several attractive varieties of parrots and cockatoos—as well as of crocodiles and such mammals as koalas, brushtail possums, ringtail possums, many wallaby species, and seals—reduced dramatically. Most have recovered, however. Quotas are set for the commercial taking of kangaroos each year for hides and for human and pet food. Numbers of kangaroos are constantly monitored, and there is no evidence of any reduction in the wild populations. Hundreds of thousands of muttonbirds are taken yearly for human consumption.","Fauna authorities and scientists responsible for conserving kangaroos support such commercial exploitation on scientific grounds. Many also believe that it would be in the interest of both conservation and agricultural practice to encourage husbandry of kangaroos. However, many others, both in Australia and elsewhere, are vehemently opposed to killing kangaroos for any reason. The issue has become highly political.","Australia has its share of potentially dangerous, as well as commercially useful, animals. The large saltwater crocodile (<em>Crocodilus porosus</em>) is known to eat humans. Of the many poisonous elapid snakes, the most dangerous to humans include taipans (<em>Oxyuranus</em>), smooth snakes (<em>Parademansia</em>), tiger snakes (<em>Notechis</em>), brown snakes (<em>Pseudonaja</em>), and death adders (<em>Acanthophis</em>); the latter, although smaller than the others, have large fangs, a lightning-fast strike, and highly toxic venom. About one-seventh of Australia’s snake species pose a deadly threat to humans. There are many poisonous spiders, the best-known being the <a href=\"/animal/funnel-web-spider\">funnel-web spider</a> (<em>Atrax</em>) and the red-back (<em>Latrodectus</em>). Both of those have caused human deaths, but only a minute proportion of Australia’s spiders are dangerous. Antivenins are available for the venoms of both spiders and snakes.","Ticks and internal parasitic worms are mainly harmful to stock and domestic pets, and some blood-sucking insects are disease carriers. The larvae of the sheep blowfly <em>Lucilia</em> attack sheep and cause losses worth millions of dollars to the wool industry. Locusts, weevils, and insect larvae of various sorts do great damage in agriculture.","The Australian fauna (and that of New Guinea, which is part of the Australian lithospheric plate) is markedly different from that of the other adjacent land areas (Indonesia and other nearby islands). It is now known that the difference stems from Australia’s long isolation and northward drift into its present geographic position. Thus, the Australian fauna has been derived to a large degree from the lands with which Australia was in contact when it was part of Gondwana. That part of the fauna derived from Asia, which includes the only <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/extant\">extant</a> native placental mammals (rats, mice, bats, and the dingo—the latter probably introduced by Aboriginal people), entered Australia by island-hopping or accidental drifting. As might be expected, flying animals of Asian origin (e.g., bats and birds) reached Australia before the others, and they may have done so soon after Australia separated from Antarctica. Horseshoe bats (family Hipposideridae), which are related to typical Old World forms, appear in the Australian fossil record about 20 million years before the present.","The Gondwanan component gives the Australian fauna its distinctive character. As is the case in South America, Australia has many species of marsupials, but they radiated more widely in Australia than in South America, coming to occupy virtually all mammalian adaptive <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/niches\">niches</a>.

Until recently it was assumed that placental mammals had not occurred in Australia until they emigrated southward from Asia. Nor was there evidence of distinctively Australian mammal fossils in South America.

The most significant change to take place was Prime Minister Harold Holt’s introduction of the Migration Act 1966, which allowed non-Europeans with professional and academic qualifications to apply for entry.

This radical change in policy allowed a person from any country to apply to migrate to Australia, without being discriminated against on the basis of ethnicity, gender, or religion. The policy focused on encouraging skilled and professional workers to apply for immigration to increase Australia’s productive capacity and directly benefit the economy. Mass migration programs were renounced, resulting in a dramatic decline in the number of British and European immigrants from 1975. However, a new wave of migration began with the arrival of the first Asian refugees as part of the assistance programs signed with the <a href=\"/topic/United-Nations\">United Nations</a> to provide resettlement in Australia for people fleeing hardship and government persecution in other countries.

Each of the other state capitals and the industrializing provincial centres also received their share of the influx. The impact was much smaller in the rural districts, except for the areas under irrigation.","In addition, most major world crises have introduced fresh waves of immigrants: South and Central Americans fleeing civil wars or government persecution; Hungarian refugees escaping the consequences of the <a href=\"/event/Hungarian-Revolution-1956\">Hungarian Revolution</a> in 1956; and Czechoslovaks departing in the wake of their country’s occupation by the Soviets in 1968.

Consequently, about half of the population has been born overseas or has at least one foreign-born parent.","Thereafter, the share of non-European immigrants, particularly from Asia, began to increase. Most of the debates on immigration have focused on cultural and economic issues and only peripherally on ethnicity, and (with the exception of the complex Aboriginal issues) Australians largely have been spared the kinds of interracial conflict that have scarred other immigrant societies.

Many of the larger holdings are now controlled by Australian banks and investment firms or by large domestic and foreign companies, though original pioneering families are still represented. The fulcrum of the typical big station is a compact base <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/comprising\">comprising</a> the homestead headquarters and separate buildings for the manager, overseer, general and specialized workers, garage and machine shops, butchery, shearing shed, and small airstrip. These pastoral hamlets typically accommodate between 15 and 50 individuals; a few widely scattered huts or cottages might be available for outlying workers. Thus, the private enterprise development of areas much larger than some U.S. states or groups of English counties is essentially in the keeping of small groups of tightly focused communities—albeit under leasehold, not freehold, <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tenures\">tenures</a>.","The gradual improvement in the quantity and reliability of rainfall from this difficult interior to the coast is not uniform, but it is a noticeable tendency and is accompanied by progressively denser settlement. A standard sequence begins with wheat and sheep farming on the drier margins and moves on to more-specialized wheat production and intensive livestock enterprises, <a href=\"/topic/dairying\">dairy farming</a>, and market gardening. Roughly equivalent gradations may be traced in the spacing of properties—for example, from large wheat-sheep enterprises that may exceed 2,500 acres (about 1,000 hectares) held in a mixture of freehold and leasehold tenures down to freehold dairy farms and market gardens using about 100 acres (40 hectares) apiece and often much less than that. Irrigation developments interrupt the sequence in all states.","A combination of government enterprise and the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/initiatives\">initiatives</a> of pioneer families had established the main outlines of this framework by <a href=\"/event/World-War-I\">World War I</a> in the older states and a little later in Queensland and Western Australia. The existence of characteristic Australian farming and grazing belts from state to state can be exaggerated, but, to the extent that these exist, they are the product of common objectives in settlement policy and represent a gradual clarification, by people and governments, of the importance of regional environmental quality.","Prominent mining centres such as <a href=\"/place/Mount-Isa\">Mount Isa</a> in Queensland and <a href=\"/place/Broken-Hill\">Broken Hill</a> in New South Wales are exceptions to the rule that sizable towns cannot be supported in the Outback.

Small service centres are distributed through every region in proportion to the intensity of rural production. Insulated yet also restricted by remoteness, the economies of most of the larger towns incorporate food and fibre processing and assorted light industries. Several towns have been assisted by state and federal decentralization policies aimed largely at reducing the extraordinary concentration in the state and territorial capitals.","Aboriginal land rights campaigners in Northern Territory and in Western Australia and South Australia have achieved significant successes, contributing to the Australianization of the wider national Aboriginal community.

Chemical deficiencies are particularly common, and it is often necessary to apply generous amounts of phosphate and traces of numerous other nutrients.","With good reason, Australia is regularly described as the driest of the inhabited continents, and vast areas of the country are unsuitable for agricultural production. The average annual rainfall is approximately 18 inches (460 mm), and more than one-third of the mainland, principally the interior, receives less than 10 inches (250 mm). Aridity or semiaridity prevails over most of Australia, and evaporation rates are extremely high, so that less than 2 inches (50 mm) of the national total contributes <a href=\"/science/runoff\">surface runoff</a> for natural and modified systems.

In the late 1980s it was roughly estimated that, with the exception of the <a href=\"/place/Northern-Territory\">Northern Territory</a>, the proportions of forest and scrub cover cleared during two centuries of European occupation was between one-third and two-thirds in each state. Even if this is somewhat overstated, it suggests a thoroughly savage onslaught, given the relatively short period of European occupation and the European population’s originally restricted distribution.","Overgrazing has caused some deterioration of the saltbush, stunted trees, and native grasslands of the interior, but in the tropics the productivity of the original pastures has been increased by introducing improved strains of grasses and heat- and tick-resistant cattle.

The threat of soil salinization was reported later, especially in the irrigation districts where it was associated with overwatering and poor drainage.","With more than half of Australian land currently being privately owned by land managers or farmers, environmentalists and government agencies have recognized the importance of <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collaborating\">collaborating</a> with local <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/communities\">communities</a> to work toward more sustainable agricultural practices. The key to successful agricultural production is through the maintenance and protection of rich biodiversity in the local area.

In 1989 Landcare, a movement of grassroots organizations, became an official federal government program, the National Landcare Programme. A “Decade of Landcare Plan” was proclaimed for the 1990s, and a nationally coordinated schedule was drawn up to promote new cultivation methods, extensive tree planting, modest and adventurous engineering solutions, and wholesale changes in production systems.","By the 2010s the Landcare movement involved more than 5,400 groups across Australia, with some 90 percent of farmers actively taking part. Recognizing the important role played by Landcare, the government continued to provide millions of dollars in financial assistance to support farmers in carrying out restoration and conservation projects, such as revegetation of native plants, better control of weeds and pests that threaten ecosystems and habitats, and the practice of rotational grazing (moving livestock between paddocks to avoid overgrazing).","Greening Australia, another leading environmental organization, also played an important role in helping to restore the health and productivity of farmlands by working in partnership with landowners, businesses, communities, and all levels of government to <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/implement\">implement</a> large-scale landscape conservation and resource management projects, such as planting thousands of trees and plants every year, which provide food and shelter for wildlife, rehabilitating degraded and overgrazed land, and protecting thousands of native species.

Concurrently, there was a precipitous drop in sheep farming’s proportion of total agricultural revenues. By contrast, Australia’s grain and combined grain and livestock production held stable at about two-fifths of agricultural turnover. During the early 1950s, agricultural production accounted for between one-sixth and one-fifth of the <a href=\"/topic/gross-domestic-product\">gross domestic product</a> (GDP), but by the beginning of the 21st century that proportion had declined to less than 5 percent. Much of the decline was attributed to reorganized economic priorities; some of it, however, was the result of increasing competition from European and North American producers who took advantage of subsidies and enhancement programs.","The number and importance of small operations has also steadily declined. Roughly half of the country’s farm establishments combined now contribute less than one-fifth of Australia’s total agricultural output, but about one-tenth of the farm businesses account for roughly half of production.","Australia is an important source of export cereals, meat, sugar, dairy produce, and fruit. Landholdings are characteristically large, specialized, owner-operated, capital-intensive, export-oriented, and intricately interlinked through the activities of producers’ associations and government organizations. Less than one-tenth of the country is used for intensive production; one-fourth is virtually unused, and three-fifths is employed for sparse grazing on natural or near-natural pastures. Only a minute fraction is irrigated. <a href=\"/plant/wheat\">Wheat</a> is the country’s leading grain crop and is grown in every state, with production concentrated in the wheat belts of the southeast and southwest. Up to four-fifths of the grain is exported, chiefly to eastern Asia, the <a href=\"/place/Middle-East\">Middle East</a>, and the Pacific region. In contrast to its Northern Hemisphere competitors, Australia does not have the standard winter or spring wheats and does not produce red-grained wheat; rather, all Australian wheats are white-grained, principally intended for breads and noodles, and are planted in the winter months of May, June, and July.

Production operations are highly sophisticated, from planting and harvesting to milling; the most <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/arduous\">arduous</a> manual labour traditionally associated with this cultivation was replaced long ago by efficient mechanization. Sugar represents Australia’s second-biggest crop export.","Other important crops include cotton (the second most valuable crop, after wheat), rice, tobacco, temperate and tropical fruits, corn (maize), sorghum, oilseeds, and a host of other items reflecting the expansive latitudinal range of farming operations. <a href=\"/topic/wine\">Wine</a> making for domestic and export markets is pursued in every state but is most significant in the southern parts of the country.

In belts with higher precipitation levels (15–25 inches [380–635 mm] annually) sheep are farmed in conjunction with wheat and other cereals, and the flocks include breeds other than the Merino. Approximately two-fifths of the national flock is located in these “wheat-and-sheep” belts. Areas with moderately reliable rainfall produce most of Australia’s superfine wool. Mutton and lamb production is particularly important in mixed-farming areas of Victoria, commonly in association with wheat.","Australia’s total <a href=\"/animal/cattle-livestock\">cattle</a> population peaked in the mid-1970s and has subsequently shrunk by about one-fourth. Most of Australia’s beef cattle are raised in Queensland, the Northern Territory, and New South Wales, but the industry is important in all productive regions.

Management styles range from high-tech sophistication on numerous southern properties to a more rough-and-ready approach on giant northern cattle stations, where the annual musters (roundups) resemble hunting expeditions and the stockmen’s horses have been replaced by helicopters, motorbikes, and four-wheel-drive vehicles.","Another characteristic of the <a href=\"/place/Outback\">Outback</a> beef industry is that stock is transported long distances to meat-processing centres or pasture.

Manufacturing became an instrument of development policy, and government assistance was provided in several forms, including by imposing protective tariffs designed to increase employment through import substitution and by the deliberate seeding of selected population centres with government-aided industries. Foreign investment increased steadily after 1950; overseas interests now control about one-third of the manufacturing sector.","Japanese and American corporations are prominent in the motor vehicle industry, which includes assembly and full-production plants. Motor vehicle manufacture is a principal source of employment in each of the mainland state capitals and has become closely associated with immigrant labour.

About two-thirds of the employment in manufacturing is concentrated in New South Wales and Victoria.","Since the 1960s manufacturing has declined steadily. The change is attributable to the independent decisions of multinational corporations to move production offshore to Asian countries with lower wages, to reductions in protective tariffs and other controls on imports, and to increasing domestic labour costs.

The system has been modified several times, though its broad outlines remain intact. In 1956 the court, which was vested with both judicial and arbitral powers (found to be in violation of the constitution), was replaced by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, which in turn was supplanted in 1973 by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

Minerals contribute nearly one-third of export income, with coal being the most important; also significant are gold and iron ore. The combined share of the mining and manufacturing sectors is more than double that for agricultural products—which accounts for roughly one-fifth of total exports—and provides another contrast between the colonial and modern economies. The leading imports are machinery and transport equipment (including motor vehicles), electronic and telecommunications equipment, miscellaneous manufactured items, chemicals and petroleum products, and foods and beverages.","Historical trends in trading patterns emphasize the colonial-to-modern transition.

In the 2010s Australia’s major trading partners included China, Japan, the United States, South Korea, and Singapore.","Some analysts have interpreted these changes as evidence of a substitution of one form of colonial status for another. Proponents of this view often refer to the close intertwining of Japanese industrial expansion and the direct influence exerted by Japanese investment in Australia, notably in the mining of coal and iron ore. The argument is complicated, however, by the continuing strength of Australian-U.S. connections and especially by expanding trade ties with several industrializing neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region, most notably China, which by the first decade of the 21st century had become Australia’s biggest trading partner.

Moreover, the main lines of road and rail transport were laid down in the second half of the 19th century, when Australia was a collection of separate colonies, each of which looked to Britain for most of its trade. The transport system was designed to maintain this trade, with roads and railways radiating from the main ports. Little thought was given to internal transport between the colonies. An unfortunate relic of this situation was that three different railway gauges were maintained. It was not until 1970 that it became possible to go by train from Sydney on the east coast to <a href=\"/place/Perth-Western-Australia\">Perth</a> in the west without changing trains. Air, rail, and water transport services were owned by the government until the 1980s, when a process of deregulation and privatization began.","Australia is almost entirely devoid of internal waterways. The <a href=\"/place/Murray-Darling-river-system\">Murray-Darling system</a> supplied important arteries in the 19th century, when it was used to transport wool and other produce from the country districts of New South Wales and Victoria to the coast.

Modern expressways and throughways are becoming standard features in the larger capitals.","Rail transport has played a crucial role in the Australian economy, but most systems have suffered in competition with road and air services.

An Overseas Telecommunications Commission, established in 1946, was given a monopoly in international telecommunications. In 1975 telecommunications functions were vested in Telecom Australia, which was given a monopoly for all domestic services. In the early 1980s satellite services were made the responsibility of AUSSAT, which was publicly owned and which started commercial services in 1985.

From Britain, <a href=\"/biography/David-Collins\">David Collins</a> sailed in 1803 to settle <a href=\"/place/Port-Phillip-District\">Port Phillip</a>. His sojourn there was unhappy, and in mid-1804 he moved to the <a href=\"/place/River-Derwent-river-Tasmania-Australia\">River Derwent</a> in southern <a href=\"/place/Tasmania\">Tasmania</a>, already settled (September 1803) by a group from Sydney under <a href=\"/biography/John-Bowen\">John Bowen</a>. Collins resettled the amalgamated parties at <a href=\"/place/Hobart-Tasmania-Australia\">Hobart</a>. In November 1804 <a href=\"/biography/William-Paterson-British-explorer\">William Paterson</a> founded a settlement in northern Tasmania, the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/precursor\">precursor</a> of <a href=\"/place/Launceston-Tasmania-Australia\">Launceston</a>. These settlements united in 1812; they were still under supervision from Sydney, although only nominally from 1825. Among penal outstations settled from Sydney were those at <a href=\"/place/Newcastle-New-South-Wales\">Newcastle</a> (1804) and <a href=\"/place/Moreton-Bay\">Moreton Bay</a> (1824), the forerunner of <a href=\"/place/Brisbane\">Brisbane</a>. <a href=\"/place/British-Empire\">Britain</a> extended its possession over the whole of the continent in the 1820s, again fearing French (or even American) intervention. The western boundary of the governor’s commission shifted to 129° in 1825 to include <a href=\"/place/Bathurst-New-South-Wales\">Bathurst</a> and Melville islands in the far north, and there was a small settlement in this region (1824–29). At Western Port, east of Port Phillip, another settlement was made (1826–27), while in January 1827 <a href=\"/biography/Edmund-Lockyer\">Edmund Lockyer</a> began permanent settlement at <a href=\"/place/Albany-Western-Australia\">Albany</a>, Western Australia. His instructions stated that Britain now claimed all Australia.","As remarked above, the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constitutional\">constitutional</a> structure was authoritarian. The governors were all service officers. There were no representative institutions, but Acts introduced in 1823 and 1828 provided for executive and legislative councils, with the major officers of government serving in both and an equal number of private individuals, chosen by nomination, in the latter. More significant at this stage was the articulation of a <a href=\"/topic/judiciary\">judicial system</a>, especially the establishment of supreme courts (New South Wales, 1814; Tasmania, 1824); normal trial by jury did not obtain.","Within this rigid structure, sociopolitical factions developed. Most important in the early years was the assertion of the <a href=\"/topic/New-South-Wales-Corps\">New South Wales Corps</a>, stationed at Sydney from 1791. Some officers of the corps sought power and profit with an avidity that led to clash after clash with the early governors. This culminated in the events of January 26, 1808, when <a href=\"/biography/John-Macarthur\">John Macarthur</a>, a former officer of the corps, led an uprising known as the <a href=\"/event/Rum-Rebellion\">Rum Rebellion</a> that deposed Governor <a href=\"/biography/William-Bligh\">William Bligh</a> (served 1806–08), earlier famous for the <em>Bounty</em> mutiny. In due course the imperial government reacted and recalled the corps; but Governor <a href=\"/biography/Lachlan-Macquarie\">Lachlan Macquarie</a> (served 1810–21) also clashed with the colony’s <a href=\"/topic/Exclusive-Australian-history\">Exclusives</a>—former officers and a handful of wealthy free immigrants. Macquarie associated himself with the <a href=\"/topic/Emancipist\">Emancipist</a> faction, a group that argued in favour of former convicts having a particular claim upon government and the colony’s resources.","Macquarie’s attitude disturbed the imperial government. After an official inquiry (1819–21) by John Thomas Bigge, the government encouraged the migration of men of some standing and wealth to both New South Wales and Tasmania. Such men received substantial grants of land and appeared to be the natural leaders of social and economic development. The Emancipists continued to be strong, however, especially through the leadership of <a href=\"/biography/W-C-Wentworth\">William Charles Wentworth</a> (himself the son of a convict woman), whose newspaper, the <em>Australian</em> (founded 1824), was the spearhead of opposition, especially to Governor Ralph Darling (served 1825–31). In Tasmania factions never formed so clearly, but there, also, the press led <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/criticism\">criticism</a> of the government.","By 1830 about 58,000 <a href=\"/topic/penal-colony\">convicts</a>, including almost 50,000 men, had come to Australia (the rate increasing rapidly after 1815). Many were urban thieves. There were a few political prisoners, while a substantial proportion of the Irish convicts (at least a third of the total) had become offenders through sociopolitical unrest. In Australia the convicts were either employed by the government or “assigned” to private employers. In general, conditions were not especially harsh or repressive, and “tickets of leave” and pardons provided relatively quick routes to freedom. Assignment to the new settlers of the 1820s, however, often had an element of slavery, and many convicts must have suffered grief and despair in their exile. Most convicts committed some further misdeeds, although only about one-tenth were charged with serious offenses. Those found guilty went to secondary penal stations, the (sometimes exaggerated) horror spots of Australian history—<a href=\"/place/Macquarie-Harbour\">Macquarie Harbour</a>, <a href=\"/place/Newcastle-New-South-Wales\">Newcastle</a>, and <a href=\"/place/Moreton-Bay\">Moreton Bay</a> in this period and, later, <a href=\"/place/Norfolk-Island\">Norfolk Island</a> and <a href=\"/place/Port-Arthur-inlet-Tasmania-Australia\">Port Arthur</a>. The convicts gave Australia a <em>Lumpenproletariat</em>; but success stories were common enough, and many convicts led decent lives. There were only a few large-scale protests; the most remarkable was the <a href=\"/event/Castle-Hill-Rising\">Castle Hill Rising</a> among Irish convicts outside Sydney in March 1804. Altogether, the impact of such a large convict population was less grim and ugly than might be expected.","The maintenance of convicts was essentially the economic resource of the colony for many years; this function entailed very considerable expenditure by the British government. Wealth was won by supplying government stores with food and grain or by controlling internal trade—or both. The officers of the New South Wales Corps were skilled in filling these roles, although civil officers, private settlers, former convicts, and even serving convicts all had their own means of doing business, and the amount of petty commercial activity was large. Farming was pursued on a widely ranging scale. <a href=\"/biography/John-Macarthur\">John Macarthur</a> was the most notable of those who early believed that <a href=\"/topic/wool\">wool</a> growing would be a major economic resource; he himself received a substantial land grant in 1805 to pursue this hope, and he persuaded Bigge of its validity. By 1830 these hopes were still some distance from fulfillment: sheep long returned more value from their meat than from their wool, and the breeding of wooled sheep suitable to the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environment\">environment</a> took time. The 1820s saw that process quickening, with relatively greater strength in Tasmania. <a href=\"/topic/sealing-hunting\">Sealing</a> and <a href=\"/topic/whaling\">whaling</a> also proved profitable, although the richest seal fields (especially in Bass Strait) were soon thinned; and not until the 1820s did colonists have the wealth to engage seriously in whaling, although British and Americans early used Australian ports for this purpose. Maritime adventure led early colonists to make contact with Pacific islands, most importantly Tahiti.","The period saw some notable exploration by land. From early days in Sydney settlers sought a way over the mountains, some 50–100 miles west. The task was accomplished in 1813; the young Wentworth led the party. A surveyor, <a href=\"/biography/George-William-Evans\">George William Evans</a>, followed their route to Bathurst (founded 1815) and reported rich pastoral country. <a href=\"/biography/John-Oxley\">John Oxley</a> further mapped the inland plains and rivers, especially the Lachlan and Macquarie, and also explored the southern coasts of the future Queensland (1823), while <a href=\"/biography/Allan-Cunningham-Scottish-poet\">Allan Cunningham</a> was the great pioneer of that state’s hinterland (1827). Meanwhile, in 1824–25, <a href=\"/biography/Hamilton-Hume\">Hamilton Hume</a> and William Hovell went overland southward to the western shore of Port Phillip. <a href=\"/biography/Charles-Sturt\">Charles Sturt</a> in 1828–30 won still greater fame by tracing the Murray-Murrumbidgee-Darling river system down to the Murray’s mouth.","The writings of explorers and pioneers were Australia’s first contributions to literary culture. While catering to the European appetite for natural history, they sometimes achieved literary grace. Pictorial illustrations of the new land, some by convicts, also dated from the earliest years. <a href=\"/biography/David-Collins\">David Collins’s</a> <em>An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales</em> (1798) and <a href=\"/biography/W-C-Wentworth\">Wentworth’s</a> <em>Description of New South Wales</em> (1817) were literate, informed, and impressive. Wentworth showed skill as a versifier, too, especially in his <em>Australasia</em> (1823). Newspapers were founded as early as 1803, and they contributed to cultural as well as political history. Outstanding was the architecture of <a href=\"/biography/Francis-Greenway\">Francis Greenway</a>, a former convict, who, under Macquarie’s patronage, designed churches and public buildings that remain among the most beautiful in Australia."],"sections":[],"isFilled":true}],"isFilled":true},{"level":3,"id":"ref42402","sidebarHeader":"A major shift: 1830–60","header":"A major shift: 1830–60","paragraphs":["The three decades between 1830 and 1860 saw rapid change.

The Colonial Office discouraged schemes for massive proprietorial grants; still the idea persisted, with Thomas Peel—kinsman of the future prime minister Sir Robert Peel—investing heavily. But colonization was grim work in a hot, dry land, with the government reluctant to expend resources. Western Australia’s story for decades was survival, not success.","Yet enthusiasm quickly generated around proposals to establish a colony in <a href=\"/place/South-Australia\">South Australia</a>, inspired by the British social reformer <a href=\"/biography/Edward-Gibbon-Wakefield\">Edward Gibbon Wakefield</a>. He argued that, if land were sold at a “sufficient” price, its owners would be forced to maximize its value by cultivation, while labourers would have to lend their energies to that task before being able to become landowners themselves. Wakefield’s ideas appealed to the liberal intelligentsia and to dissenting groups in England. Both of these elements backed <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nascent\">nascent</a> South Australia. The first colonists arrived in 1836, and <a href=\"/place/Adelaide\">Adelaide</a> was settled the following year.

The <a href=\"/event/Australian-Colonies-Government-Act\">Australian Colonies Government Act</a> (1850) extended this situation to Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania. The act made allowance for further revision of the colonial constitutions, and in 1855–56 this took effect in the four colonies, Tasmania then abandoning the name Van Diemen’s Land. Queensland followed after its separation from New South Wales. All had bicameral legislatures, with ministers responsible to the lower houses, which by 1860, except in Tasmania, were elected on a near-democratic basis (all adult non-Aboriginal men were eligible to vote). In Victoria and South Australia the secret ballot was introduced in 1856 (<em>see</em> <a href=\"/topic/Australian-ballot\">Australian ballot</a>).","While the imperial power thus responded to colonial cries for self-rule, on the way there were some tense moments. Virtually all colonists <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/abhorred\">abhorred</a> paying taxes for imperial purposes, including the costs of maintaining convicts locally; a good many disliked convictism altogether; most disputed the imperial right to dictate land policy; and many, especially in South Australia, disapproved of the imperial government’s directing that aid be given to religious denominations.","From the outset of the period, the imperial government fostered a freer market in land and labour throughout the colonies, not merely in South Australia. Thus, grants of land ceased in 1831, replaced by sale. Attempts to create a pastoral-lease system caused much friction, with colonists generally hostile to any demand for payment. In New South Wales in 1844, new regulations even prompted talk of rebellion.","With regard to labour, colonists agreed with imperial encouragement of free migration, but friction arose over the <a href=\"/topic/penal-colony\">convicts</a>. British opinion in the 1830s became increasingly critical of the assignment of convicts to private employers as smacking of slavery; it was abolished in 1840, and with it transportation of convicts to the mainland virtually ceased, although increased numbers were sent to Tasmania. The end of assignment removed the chief virtue of transportation, from the colonists’ viewpoint, and so contributed to a vigorous movement against its continuation. The British government ended transportation to eastern Australia in 1852. In Western Australia transportation began in 1850, at the colonists’ behest, and continued until 1868. Altogether some 151,000 convicts were sent to eastern Australia and nearly 10,000 to Western Australia.","In the early 1850s the most dramatic political problem arose from the <a href=\"/event/gold-rush\">gold rushes</a>.

Lyons led a wholly UAP government until 1934 and UAP-Country coalitions until his death in 1939.","The Lyons governments provided stability and not much more.

The UAP elected <a href=\"/biography/Robert-Menzies\">Robert Gordon Menzies</a> its new leader (and therefore prime minister); but the decision was hard fought, and it was criticized publicly and vehemently by Page, still leader of the Country Party.

Australia did not ratify the <a href=\"/event/Statute-of-Westminster\">Statute of Westminster</a> (1931, embodying the 1926 <a href=\"/topic/Balfour-Report\">Balfour Report</a> as to the constitutional equality of the dominions) until 1942. The UAP <a href=\"/topic/government\">governments</a> followed Britain closely in its attitude toward the totalitarian expansion of the 1930s; if Australian influence counted for anything, it was to strengthen <a href=\"/topic/appeasement-foreign-policy\">appeasement</a> of <a href=\"/place/Germany\">Germany</a> and <a href=\"/place/Japan\">Japan</a>. Although fear of Japan continued, that country’s accession to the fascist camp did not provoke a tougher governmental line. The government suspected that Britain could not control the <a href=\"/place/Eastern-Hemisphere\">Eastern Hemisphere</a> but found no answer to that dire problem. The Labor Party meanwhile was even more incoherent and variable in matters of <a href=\"/topic/foreign-policy\">foreign policy</a> than were its social democratic counterparts elsewhere in the Western world: <a href=\"/topic/isolationism-foreign-policy\">isolationism</a> and antifascism were equal and opposing forces."],"sections":[],"isFilled":true},{"level":4,"id":"ref42428","sidebarHeader":"World War II","header":"World War II","paragraphs":["When <a href=\"/topic/war\">war</a> came again, however, the nation’s response was firm—some 30,000 Australians died in <a href=\"/event/World-War-II\">World War II</a> (1938–45), and 65,000 were injured. From early in the war, the Royal Australian Air Force was active in the defense of Britain. The Australian Navy operated in the <a href=\"/place/Mediterranean-Sea\">Mediterranean Sea</a> (1940–41), helping to win the Battle of Cape Matapan (March 1941). Australian troops fought in the seesaw battles of <a href=\"/place/North-Africa\">North Africa</a>.","In mid-1941 Australians suffered heavy losses both in the Allied defeats in <a href=\"/place/Greece\">Greece</a> and <a href=\"/place/Crete\">Crete</a> and in the victories in the <a href=\"/place/Levant\">Levant</a>. Meanwhile, the German general <a href=\"/biography/Erwin-Rommel\">Erwin Rommel</a> was scoring his greatest triumphs in North Africa. Out of these emerged the successful Allied defense of <a href=\"/place/Tobruk\">Tobruk</a>, carried out substantially by Australians (April–December 1941), and the decisive victory at the battles of <a href=\"/place/El-Alamein\">El-Alamein</a>, in which an Australian division played a key role.","After the <a href=\"/topic/history-of-Japan\">Japanese</a> attacked the U.S. naval base at <a href=\"/topic/Pearl-Harbor\">Pearl Harbor</a>, <a href=\"/place/Hawaii-state\">Hawaii</a> (December 7, 1941), however, the focus shifted homeward. The Japanese victories of the following months more than fulfilled the fantasies that fear and hate had long prompted in Australia. On February 15, 1942, 15,000 Australians became prisoners of war when <a href=\"/place/Singapore\">Singapore</a> fell to Japanese forces, and four days later war came to the nation’s shores when <a href=\"/place/Darwin-Northern-Territory\">Darwin</a> was bombed. Then came a Japanese swing southward that by August threatened to overrun <a href=\"/place/Port-Moresby\">Port Moresby</a>, <a href=\"/place/New-Guinea\">New Guinea</a>.","When Australia entered the war, compulsory military training was reintroduced by the Menzies government and commenced in January 1940. All unmarried men age 21  were required to complete three months of compulsory military training in the Citizen Military Forces (also known as the Militia). Because the Defence Act of 1903 restricted conscription to soldiers fighting on Australian land, a separate volunteer force, the 2nd Australian Imperial Force, was established to send troops to fight abroad while the Citizens Military Force defended the homeland and its territories.","In 1942 the worsening situation in the Pacific and in Southeast Asia, along with the consequent threat of a Japanese land invasion in northern Australia, caused widespread panic in Australia and led the government to take drastic measures to protect the country and its territories. John Curtin, leader of the Australian Labor Party, who had succeeded Menzies as prime minister, reversed his strong personal opposition to compulsory overseas military service to allow the government to conscript soldiers to fight the Japanese in the “South-West Pacific Area.” Enacted on February 19, 1943, the Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Act of 1943 extended the defense of Australia to include the territory of New Guinea and adjacent islands, thus allowing for the conscription of Australian troops to serve in the “South-Western Pacific Zone.”","The <a href=\"/place/United-States\">United States</a> became Australia’s major ally. In a famous statement (December 1941), Prime Minister Curtin declared: “I make it quite clear that Australia looks to America, free from any pangs about our traditional links of friendship to Britain.” A sharper note of independence from Britain came when Curtin insisted (February 1942) that Australian troops recalled from the <a href=\"/place/Middle-East\">Middle East</a> should return to Australia itself and not help in the defense of Burma (<a href=\"/place/Myanmar\">Myanmar</a>) as British Prime Minister <a href=\"/biography/Winston-Churchill\">Winston Churchill</a> wished. Conversely, American needs prompted total response to Curtin’s call. U.S. Gen. <a href=\"/biography/Douglas-MacArthur\">Douglas MacArthur</a>, commander in chief of the South-West Pacific Area, established his headquarters first in <a href=\"/place/Melbourne-Queensland\">Melbourne</a> and then in <a href=\"/plant/Brisbane-box\">Brisbane</a>.","The large U.S. military presence in Brisbane was not without problems. When American troops began arriving in Australia in December 1941, their presence was warmly welcomed. However, Australian attitudes toward them began to change, particularly the attitude of Australian soldiers who felt threatened by the attention Australian women showed toward the better-paid, more stylishly uniformed American soldiers. The increasing tension erupted into the “<a href=\"/event/Battle-of-Brisbane\">Battle of Brisbane</a>,” two nights of large-scale rioting that took place between Australians and U.S. servicemen in Brisbane’s central business district on November 26–27, 1942. One Australian died and hundreds were wounded on both sides as a result of the violent clash.","Brisbane also figured large in an <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alleged\">alleged</a> defense strategy that ultimately proved to be a canard, according to which, in the event of a Japanese invasion, the northern parts of the continent beyond “the Brisbane Line” between Brisbane and Perth were to have been conceded to the enemy without resistance. Supposedly, the objective of this plan was to concentrate Australian armed forces between Brisbane and Melbourne, where most of the crucial industrial regions were located. The idea was that the sheer distance that would have to be traveled by Japanese forces to reach the Brisbane Line would be debilitating for them.","During an election campaign in October 1942, Labor minister Edward Ward accused the previous Menzies and Fadden governments of having planned this strategy, though he had no evidence to support his claims. MacArthur’s mention of the “Brisbane Line” to reporters in March 1943 sparked further public concern and controversy. A Royal Commission  that operated from June to September 1943, however, determined that no such plan had ever existed as an official policy. Indeed, MacArthur decided that the best way to stop Japanese forces from advancing to Australia was to make a stand in New Guinea.","Meanwhile, on land, the fortunes of <a href=\"/topic/war\">war</a> turned against the Japanese in August–September 1942, beginning with an Allied (primarily Australian) victory at <a href=\"/place/Milne-Bay\">Milne Bay</a>, New Guinea. More prolonged—and of more heroic dimension in Australian eyes—was the forcing back of the Japanese from southern New Guinea over the Kokoda Track (or Trail), along which Australian soldiers put up strong resistance against seemingly overwhelming odds. The Japanese, having failed to capture <a href=\"/place/Port-Moresby\">Port Moresby</a> by sea in the <a href=\"/event/Battle-of-the-Coral-Sea\">Battle of the Coral Sea</a> (May 4–8, 1942), landed in northern New Guinea at the beachheads of Gona and Buna on July 21, 1942, with the intention of taking the New Guinea capital by pushing south over the rugged <a href=\"/place/Owen-Stanley-Range\">Owen Stanley Range</a> along the Kokoda Track. In a series of engagements during what proved to be a four-month campaign, Australian troops eventually forced their more powerful adversary to withdraw, retaking the Kokoda region on November 2, 1942. Their actions arguably saved Australia from Japanese invasion and, as such, formed a defining moment in Australian history. The endurance, courage, “mateship,” and never-give-up attitude the Australian soldiers displayed during the campaign fostered the so-called ANZAC <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legend\">legend</a>, the tradition of the indomitable spirit of Australian troops that began with the original<a href=\"/topic/ANZAC\"> ANZAC</a>s in the <a href=\"/event/Gallipoli-Campaign\">Gallipoli Campaign</a> of 1915 and continues today as an important element of national identity.","A long <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attrition\">attrition</a> of Japanese forces elsewhere in New Guinea and the islands followed the <a href=\"/event/Kokoda-Track-Campaign\">Kokoda Track Campaign</a>, with Australia initially playing a major role and subsequently playing a role secondary to American forces. Both Australian volunteers and conscripts fought in these campaigns, the government and people having accepted the legitimacy of sending conscripts as far north as the <a href=\"/place/Equator\">Equator</a> and as far west and east as the 110th and 159th <a href=\"/science/meridian-geography\">meridians</a>.","Because defeat in the Battles of the Coral Sea and <a href=\"/event/Battle-of-Midway\">Midway</a> prevented Japan from continuing to supply its forces in Burma (<a href=\"/place/Myanmar\">Myanmar</a>) by sea, the Japanese high command undertook the building of a rail line between <a href=\"/place/Thailand\">Thailand</a> and Burma. In addition to Asian labourers, more than 60,000 Allied <a href=\"/topic/prisoner-of-war\">prisoners of war</a> (POWs), including about 13,000 Australians, were forced to construct the 260-mile (415-km) Burma (Thai-Burma) Railway Line. Subject to cruel punishment and torture, the POWs also suffered from disease and malnutrition. As a result, more than one-fifth of them, including more than 2,800 Australians, died during the yearlong (October 1942–October 1943) construction of the railway. The will to survive exhibited by the Australian POWs—including Lieut. Col. <a href=\"/biography/Weary-Dunlop\">Ernest Edward (“Weary”) Dunlop</a>, an army surgeon who risked his life by standing up to his Japanese captors to protect the men in his care—contributed further to the ANZAC legend.","There were more than two dozen POW camps in Australia. On August 5, 1944, one of the largest POW breakouts in history occurred at the facility in <a href=\"/place/Cowra\">Cowra</a> in east-central New South Wales. In the wee hours of the morning, more than 1,100 Japanese POWs staged a mass breakout, storming the barbed-wire fence surrounding the camp. More than 300 prisoners managed to escape, but within nine days all of the escapees who had not chosen to kill themselves were recaptured. In all, 231 Japanese POWs died as a result of the breakout.","The war brought some passion into domestic affairs, <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/albeit\">albeit</a> less than in <a href=\"/event/World-War-I\">World War I</a>. Curtin’s government exercised considerable control over the civilian population, “industrial conscription” being scarcely an exaggerated description.

Curtin easily won the 1943 <a href=\"/topic/election-political-science\">elections</a>.

Urban employment was bountiful, and concentration in the state capitals became more marked than ever. Many families had two or more income earners. Thus, affluence quickened.

The <a href=\"/topic/gross-national-product\">gross national product</a> increased by more than one-half between 1938–39 and 1942–43 and by the end of that time was nearly triple what it had been at the end of World War I.","World War II also proved to be a significant turning point in the role of women, and the wartime efforts of various women’s groups and their volunteer service to the community were recognized and praised. More women also joined the workforce to replace men who had left for war, bringing about a significant change in the traditional role of women, who had previously remained in the home to manage domestic responsibilities and raise children.

The arrival and presence of over 100,000  U.S. troops in Australia from 1941 had a substantial impact on postwar culture and society. The American alliance with Australia during the war forged close ties between the two countries, and Australia came to depend on the United States for military support as well as economic growth. Prior to the war, Australian society had been largely influenced by conservative British culture, mirroring its entertainment, music, and sports as well as its social attitudes. By the end of the war a significant change was underway, however, and from the 1950s onward Australian lifestyles felt the dramatic impact of the new more rebellious culture of the United States, which had emerged from the war in a powerful economic position.","The strong cultural influence that the United States exerted over other Western countries, especially Australia, was profound. Because Australia also experienced an economic boom as a result of the war, its newfound affluent position enabled Australians to embrace innovative new and now more-affordable products and technologies, many of which were imported from the more industrialized United States. American ideals and cultural products, such as film and music, quickly dispersed throughout Australian society, with an accompanying move away from the traditional restricted ways of prewar life to a more liberated and expressive lifestyle.","Film-going had become one of the most popular pastimes for Australian people during World War II, as motion pictures provided a form of escapism from the horrors of the real wartime world. In 1945 alone, 151 million cinema admissions were recorded in Australia. Most of the films shown on Australian screens between the 1940s and ’50s, however, were produced by American companies. Australian-made films were in very short supply in the early 1950s. Many of the American films appealed to a teenage audience with their depiction of radical American social themes and ideals. This exposure undoubtedly had an impact upon impressionable adolescents, sparking the birth of a new youth culture in Australia.","The introduction of <a href=\"/topic/television-broadcasting\">television</a> in Australia in September 1956 provided a new cultural experience and resulted in a dramatic decline in cinema attendance. Television quickly became one of the most popular forms of entertainment and one of the most influential mediums in the country. The Australian government had been determined to have the country’s first television network up and running in time for the Melbourne Olympic Games, and it met this objective with some two months to spare.","In the initial years after television’s arrival, not many Australians could afford the new technology.  However, as televisions became less expensive, the number of Australians who owned a television rapidly increased. Despite the enormous popularity of television, a small proportion of society opposed it, mainly because the majority of programs were American productions. With more than 80 percent of television content sourced from the United States, it was feared that American content, themes, and culture would impede the development of the Australian identity. This concern was <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alleviated\">alleviated</a> somewhat when the demand for an increase in Australian content led to the broadcasting of more Australian programs in the mid-1960s, particularly Australian dramatic series.","The proliferation of vinyl records after World War II had a major impact on the experience of music in Australia and revolutionized the music industry. By the early 1960s more than 500,000 records were being manufactured every month in Australia. This spike in record production coincided with the explosion of rebellious youth-oriented culture, sparked by the rise of <a href=\"/art/rock-and-roll-early-style-of-rock-music\">rock and roll</a>, the arrival of which in Australia is usually dated to the theatrical release in 1955 of <a href=\"/topic/Blackboard-Jungle\"></a>; the movie featured the hit single “Rock Around the Clock” by the American band <a href=\"/biography/Bill-Haley\">Bill Haley</a> and <a href=\"/topic/Bill-Haley-and-His-Comets\">His Comets</a>, whose Australian tour in 1957 was a sensation.

Put off by the accompanying changes in behaviour, fashion, and attitudes, some in the older generation blamed rock and roll for the rise in <a href=\"/topic/delinquency\">juvenile delinquency</a>.

He personified the importance within the party of an intelligentsia, radicalized in modest degree by liberationist and countercultural forces of the day as well as by more traditional left-wing sympathies.

Menzies, an ardent royalist, upheld the British position in the <a href=\"/event/Suez-Crisis\">Suez Crisis</a> of 1956.

The U.S. alliance crystallized in the 1951 Australia–<a href=\"/place/New-Zealand\">New Zealand</a>–United States (<a href=\"/event/ANZUS-Pact\">ANZUS</a>) Pact, reinforced (1955–77) by the <a href=\"/topic/Southeast-Asia-Treaty-Organization\">Southeast Asia Treaty Organization</a> (SEATO).

He was unique among Australians in his experience of traditional diplomacy, yet he was ready and able to come to terms with the new Asia. As <a href=\"/topic/history-of-Indonesia\">Indonesia</a> became an ever more populous, and sometimes assertive, nation, there was wariness in Australia, but the fall of Sukarno in 1966 helped stabilize relations for many years.

Traditionally Labor had been suspicious of mass <a href=\"/topic/immigration\">immigration</a>, seeing it as a threat to established <a href=\"/topic/wage\">wages</a> and standards. Yet in 1946 the ALP government initiated a policy that assisted the entry not only of people from the United Kingdom but also of many others from war-distressed <a href=\"/place/Europe\">Europe</a>. The peak year of net immigration (about 150,000) was 1950, while the greatest numbers of assisted migrants (about 100,000 per annum) came in the later 1960s. While it has been modified many times, this overall policy has remained in place. Closer ties with Australia’s Asian neighbours, however, moved toward abandoning the policy of virtual exclusion of “coloured” immigrants. From the late 1960s such restrictions were eased. The acceptance of refugees from <a href=\"/place/Indochina\">Indochina</a> was the most <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/palpable\">palpable</a> evidence of the new policy.

Continuing debate pondered the relative merits of “<a href=\"/topic/assimilation-society\">assimilation</a>” as against “<a href=\"/topic/multiculturalism\">multiculturalism</a>”—i.e., minimizing or encouraging the migrants’ retention of their native customs. Especially after 1970 the latter policy had official favour, but migration had surprisingly only marginal impact on established sociopolitical structures. Many tongues were heard and many cuisines eaten, but suburban living near the big cities was as compelling a goal for most migrants as for their Anglo-Celtic forerunners, and their values were shaped accordingly.

It found formal expression in a new <a href=\"/topic/political-party\">political party</a>, the <a href=\"/topic/Australian-Democrats\">Australian Democrats</a>, which was founded in 1977 and succeeded to the Democratic Labor Party’s role as a minority party of significant effect. The new radicalism also helped shape thought and action in other, more diffuse, ways.","<a href=\"/topic/Australian-Aboriginal\">Aboriginal</a> activism became more assertive than it had been since the days of physical attack on European settlers. The estimated number of persons of Aboriginal descent had risen from a nadir of 73,828 in 1933 to more than 170,000 in the early 1980s; in 1962, Aboriginal people received the franchise and, for the first time, were to be counted in the national census. Aboriginal claims moved from wage equality with Europeans to land rights over territory with Aboriginal associations. The South Australian government acted in this direction from 1966, and the federal Aboriginal Land Rights Act (1976), applying to the Northern Territory, was particularly important. In 1967 the general electorate overwhelmingly supported a constitutional <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amendment\">amendment</a> to increase Commonwealth powers in Aboriginal matters. Equality in formal civic rights, wage payments, and social welfare benefits became the norm. Some groups received considerable royalties from mining activities on their land.","The Whitlam government in particular encouraged a variety of ethnic organizations, most importantly the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee (founded in 1973, from 1977 renamed the National Aboriginal Conference). These organizations contributed to a growing strength and pride in Aboriginality. Early in the period, Aboriginal persons became known for their contributions to sport (boxer <a href=\"/biography/Lionel-Rose\">Lionel Rose</a>, tennis player <a href=\"/biography/Evonne-Goolagong-Cawley\">Evonne Goolagong Cawley</a>). Later, Aboriginal persons became celebrated in the fields of <a href=\"/topic/public-administration\">public administration</a> (Charles Perkins, Patricia O’Shane), art (Yirawala, Michael Jagamara Nelson, Emily Kngwarreye), <a href=\"/art/literature\">literature</a> (<a href=\"/biography/Oodgeroo-Noonuccal\">Kath Walker</a>, <a href=\"/biography/Colin-Johnson\">Colin Johnson</a>, <a href=\"/biography/Sally-Morgan\">Sally Morgan</a>), and politics (Neville Thomas Bonner, senator, 1971–83, and Aden Ridgeway, senator from 1999).","While various researchers had been expanding knowledge of the antiquity and richness of Aboriginal life, not all Aboriginal people accepted the right and capacity of white scholars to comprehend the tribal past, but this attitude itself affirmed their independence. School curricula began to provide sympathetic teaching of Aboriginal culture to all Australians. Such policies reinforced a shift away from assimilationist ideas. This shift applied nationwide but had particular relevance in sustaining the surviving remnants of tribal life. In the late 20th century the number of Aboriginal persons with some experience of traditional Aboriginal life was estimated to be about 10,000.","Increased awareness of past depredations against Aboriginal peoples helped shape a wider-ranging <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/critique\">critique</a> of the Australian experience. Dissidents influenced by the New Marxism of the later 1960s (notably Humphrey McQueen in his <em>A New Britannia</em>, first published in 1970) saw the nation as ever dominated by petty bourgeois standards—mean, acquisitive, racist, and authoritarian. Many earlier commentators had perceived such traits, but now they were attacked with more fundamental repugnance. The dismissal of Whitlam in 1975 encouraged the belief that essentially Australia was not a democracy and that it suffered much from a heritage of subservience to <a href=\"/place/British-Empire\">British</a> imperial standards. While this radical critique lost some acerbity after 1980, it left an impression, especially on the liberal intelligentsia. One result was greater emphasis on the dignity and autonomy of Australian-centred <a href=\"/topic/cultural-studies\">cultural studies</a>. <a href=\"/biography/Robert-Hughes\">Robert Hughes’s</a> <em>The Fatal Shore: The Epic of Australia’s Founding</em> (1987), a vivid account of the experiences of both transported convicts and colonists that became an international <a href=\"/topic/best-seller\">best seller</a>, explored Australia’s origins as a colony and its search for a national identity.","<a href=\"/science/conservation-ecology\">Environmental activism</a> developed, often spurred by repugnance to the exploitative development that radicals saw, with much truth, as central to Australian history since 1788. Some aspects of <a href=\"/topic/environmentalism\">environmentalism</a> gained support across a wide spectrum. Most state governments introduced controls about 1970. There was a particularly emotional campaign to save beautiful Lake Pedder in <a href=\"/place/Tasmania\">Tasmania</a> from conversion into a hydroelectric dam. The campaign failed in 1973, but in that year the federal government established an inquiry into the national estate, from which resulted the Australian Heritage Commission Act in 1975. In 1982 the High Court agreed that the Commonwealth had power to override states on environmental matters should the issue in question come within the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/purview\">purview</a> of an international <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/covenant\">covenant</a> to which Australia was a party. Environmentalists have exercised considerable influence as pressure groups and have made some essays into parliamentary politics: in 1989 a “Green” group acquired the <a href=\"/topic/balance-of-power\">balance of power</a> in <a href=\"/place/Tasmania\">Tasmania</a>, aided by the system of proportional representation prevailing there. While Australia contributed only a little to the mainstream of environmental theory, <a href=\"/biography/Peter-Singer\">Peter Singer</a> of Monash University won international renown for his exposition of <a href=\"/topic/animal-rights\">animal rights</a>.","Miriam Dixson in <em>The Real Matilda</em> (1976) argued that Australian <a href=\"/topic/women\">women</a> had suffered an inferior status, markedly below that of women in Western society at large. Her case was arguable, but the increasing volume of feminist studies more often stressed the achievements of women, though often against great odds, in many sectors of society and culture. Feminists played an important part in the expansion of Australian studies; women increased their share in Australian literary work, often writing on feminist themes. <a href=\"/biography/Germaine-Greer\">Germaine Greer</a>, born in Melbourne, achieved eminence for her writings.","The number of women physicians and lawyers in Australia rose significantly, but more sizable still was the impact of women in the public service. Some succeeded in federal politics, and a greater number at the state level: in 1990 Carmen Lawrence (in <a href=\"/place/Western-Australia\">Western Australia</a>) and Joan Kirner (in <a href=\"/place/Victoria-state-Australia\">Victoria</a>) were the first women to become leaders of governments.","<a href=\"/topic/gay-rights-movement\">Gay</a> and <a href=\"/topic/lesbian-feminism\">lesbian</a> activism followed much the same path in Australia as elsewhere; Sydney was said to have become one of the major “gay” cities of the world.

The resulting <a href=\"/topic/Native-Title-Act\">Native Title Act</a> (1993) was unsuccessfully challenged, and subsequently, under its judgment in 1996 (the Wik case), the High Court decided that Indigenous title and pastoral leasehold could coexist.

The many deaths of Aboriginal men while in official custody added to such feeling, and still more so invocation of the long history of Aboriginal families being forcibly separated. While all governments upheld the desirability of racial reconciliation, they remained reluctant to make a formal apology for past wrongs.","Debate as to constitutional change quickened in the late 1990s, many seeing the time as opportune for a shift to republican status.

Rudd’s hold on power was further threatened by strident opposition from business groups to the controversial Resource Super Profits Tax, a proposal targeted at the mining industry and scheduled to go into effect in 2012. Support for Rudd within the Labor Party waned so much that he did not even contest a leadership vote in June 2010 in which <a href=\"/biography/Julia-Gillard\">Julia Gillard</a> replaced him as party leader.
